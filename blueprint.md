# Your Resume

Your resume is your personal summary sheet.  Your resume is the thing that gets your foot in the door.  So, there's a few things you should do (and not do) to make it as awesome as you are.

### Make your name **BIG.**

Your name has to stand out from everything else, because you want it to be remembered.  Making it the biggest thing on the page is the easiest thing you can do to make that possible.  I've seen soooo many resumes where the name is at the top, but it's just bolded and centered and they expect that to be enough.  It's not.  

### Remove the objective.

Nobody looks at the objective.  Nobody.  I personally spoke to a bunch of recruiters from various companies and they all said that they never look at them.  Use that space to talk about projects you've done, activities you've done, etc.

### Keep it to a single page.

Recruiters are looking for a short summary of you.  They're reading several resumes a day, and if they see something longer than they typically read, they could pass over yours for something more concise!  If you'd like to say more, put a link to a personal website or portfolio for someone to find it.  A resume is a summary, not a tome.

### Remove irrelevant information.

I know that lifeguarding in high school was a good gig that helped you gain people skills and attention to detail.  But you're in tech.  That doesn't matter as much to tech companies.  Sorry, buddy.  I still think you're great with people.
When you're a first semester freshman, it's okay to have old high school stuff on there, just because it's less likely that you have other things to put on your resume.  But as soon as you have a college GPA to work with, a club or two, and some volunteer experiences to replace that, do it.

### Don't make it a scavenger hunt.

When an application reviewer (engineer, recruiter, or otherwise) is looking over your resume, don't make it difficult for them to understand who you are and what you know. 

For example, if you have online profiles like GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, or even your own personal website, put it on your resume.  Don't make them have to search long and hard for you online if they want to know more!

If you decide to put relevant coursework on your resume, **please**, don't just put course numbers.  Nobody knows what that means.  And nobody is going to go to your university's website to find out exactly what CS229 is.  Put down the course titles instead!

And finally, put down your graduation date.  So many students I've seen don't put it on there because they are hiding the fact that they're a freshman, or they're "technically a junior if you count the credits."  That doesn't matter.  Trust me.  Just put down your graduation date so that the company knows how much experience you have, and how soon they can potentially pull you in for full-time.

### Include only certain personal information.

Companies aren't allowed to ask about your religion, marital status, or race/ethnicity, so you shouldn't include that.  

In terms of contact information: you don't need your mailing address.  That is a thing of the past.  Just like my youth.  Tech companies email, and **maybe** call.  That's all you need!
Some great things that you might also want to put on there are your personal website (if you have one, which you should), your GitHub profile (if you have one, which you should), and your LinkedIn (if you have one, which you should).

Though there's some who might disagree, you should **include your GPA.**  If your major GPA is significantly higher than your overall GPA, you might want to consider having both.  When you have graduated and have a full-time job, you won't need it as much.  But at this point in your beautiful life, keep it in there.  Some companies care about GPA more than others, so you might as well play it safe and have it there.

# CV Sample

Your cover letter is your written sales pitch.  You've got a resume that summarizes everything.  Now you have to write out a more complete, professional description of you and what you can offer a given company.  Here's a sample cover letter to get you started:

> Dear _________, 
>
> I hope your day is going well! My name is _________, and I'm a _________ at _________. I am very interested in working for _________ next _________. Your commitment to _________ and _________ that I saw on the website inspired me! The products you build and the values you stand for make _________ seem like an ideal workplace for me.

A little about me, I [insert relevant work experience, extracurriculars, and projects here]. I think these experiences would make me a great candidate for you.

>
> Please let me know if there's anything else you need from me. I look forward to hearing from you! I can be reached at _________ and _________.
>
> Best regards, 
> _________

Now, remember, this is just a sample.  You can write a cover letter in any format you'd like.  But, you should be sure to include the following:

* **Who** - Who you are.  Easy enough.
* **Where** - Where you're coming from.
* **Why** - Why you're interested in this company, and show that you researched them.
* **What** - What you can bring to the table.
* **When** - When you're available to start, and when they can contact you.
* **How** - How they can reach you.

# Your Attitude

When you're internship/job hunting, it's very easy to feel down if you don't hear back from companies, an interview goes poorly, or you start comparing yourself to people.  It's a tough field we're going into.

So.  I won't spend much time on this.  But I want to emphasize something: **You're brilliant.**  You're in this field for a reason.  When your grades aren't awesome or someone gets something that you wanted, don't feel down on yourself.  So many opportunities will come your way if you just keep working hard and refining your skills.

Mark Twain once said, "Comparison is the death of joy."  When you start to compare your skills to others, it's hard to not feel as good about your own, or to get a little too competitive about your work.  Work hard and don't let others get you down.  It's remarkable how significantly that can improve both your work and your interviewing experience!

When you're talking to companies and recruiters at career fairs and hackathons and over the phone, be confident, not arrogant.  Be grateful for the opportunity they're giving you, and smile!  A great attitude will take you VERY far.

# Your Skills

Obviously, your skills are what a company is buying from you when they hire you.  So, honing in those skills and presenting them in an effective way is *probably* the most important thing in getting a gig.

## Building Them

Chances are, if you've had a data structures and/or algorithms class, you're already going to do pretty well in the technical interviews.  That is, if you can recall the information you learned.

Here's a checklist of things that you should probably be prepared to know in a technical interview:

* Data types
* Basic Bitwise Operations
* String Operations
* Arrays
* Linked Lists
  + Singly Linked
  + Doubly Linked
  + Circular Linked
* Queues
* Stacks
* Heaps
* Trees
  + Binary Trees
  + Binary Search Trees
  + Tries
  + Self Balancing Trees
* Traversing Trees
  + Breadth First Search - BFS
  + Depth First Search - DFS
  + Preorder, Inorder, Postorder
* Graphs
  + Dijkstra's Algorithm / A* Search
* Hash Maps
  + Handling Collisions
* Sorting algorithms
  + Insertion
  + Selection
  + Merge
  + Quick
* Time Complexities

This guide isn't for teaching you these skills.  But there are several guides, problem sets, and practice systems out there that can help.

Typically, for an internship or your first job, questions won't get much more specific unless you're applying for a specific role.  For example, if I wanted to be a mobile intern, I might be asked iOS/Android/Windows Phone specific questions, or if I wanted to be a web intern, I might be asked HTML/CSS/JavaScript questions, or if I wanted to be a backend intern, I might be asked about Django or Node or Ruby on Rails.  That definitely depends on the company, and what you're both looking for.

Make sure you're able to implement and use the above data structures without the assistance of an IDE. Typically, onsite technical interviews involve coding on paper or a whiteboard, and phone/video interviews usually involve some kind of collaborative text editor. Yes, that means you won't have access to auto-complete, auto-compiling, or the internet to check for errors. So be ready for that!

## Selling Them

When you're actively emailing and speaking with recruiters, they're going to ask you a lot of questions that are just checkboxes for what they're looking for in terms of skills.

If you've written anything in a language before, **put it on your resume**.  A lot of companies have parsers that look for specific things that, again, will put a tick on those checkboxes before putting you through to the next round of review.  Now, if you've only ever done "Hello, world!" in Python, don't say that you're a Python ninja or whatever.  You don't want to be thrown into an interview that will only hurt your self-confidence.  Speaking from experience.  Trust me.

When a recruiter or engineer is asking you about a certain project you've done, or how you've used a particular language, be as specific as possible.  Tell them **exactly** what you did on that particular project (or internship or what have you).  Tell them how much you contributed, what languages you used, how long was the duration of development for that project, what was the outcome of the project, etc. etc.

For example, don't say, "I'm the webmaster for a club website. Next question."  Okay, Dwight Schrute.  Go back to your beet farm.  Instead, say something more like this: "I developed and currently maintain the website for my university's computer science club. I built it from the ground up with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery on the front-end.  It's a static site, so a backend wasn't needed.  The website's main function is to promote the club and give members crucial updates about meetings and events, and I update it regularly via a Python script I wrote."  Oh my, you enchanting software engineer, you.  Let me hire you.

When you're talking to companies about specific things you've done, make sure they know:

* **What?** - What? - What did you make? What does it do? What impact has it made? What was the hardest part? What could you have done better?
* **Why?** - Why did you make it?  Was it for a hackathon, a school project, an open source contribution, or something else?
* **How?** - With which technologies did you make this?  Did you use a specific API?  What parts of it did you work on?
* **When?** - Did you do this recently or are you still living off of when you peaked in 10th grade?
* **Who?** - Did you work on this with anyone?  Who did what?  Who is this for?

Your skills are something that you have, and the reason why you have them is because you've used them in some way.  All you have to do to prove yourself is to explain yourself!  No need to gGetting a Gig: A Guide

# Your Search

You have a resume and cover letter in hand, and you have the skills to make anyone want you.  Now, you just have to find the right gig for you.

## Events

When you're on the hunt for a great internship or first job, the events you go to can really set you apart, and will help you meet people that could potentially help you in the long run.

The biggies that you will definitely run into are:

* Hackathons
* Meetups
* Conferences
* Career Fairs

So, how do you find these events?  They're happening all the time, you just need to know where to look.  Firstly, ask people in the field.  Talk to a mentor, a fellow student, a professor, a colleague... anyone could come through for you!  I remember my first tech event I went to in college was because I ran into a guy that I met orientation day.  And now he and I are coworkers.  Fancy that.  Anyway, people can get you very far.

Otherwise, when people don't work, we always have the glorious internet leading the way.  There's so many resources out there I definitely can't list them all.  So I'll list just a few.

* Your School - Yeah, this is kind of an easy shot, but not a lot of people consider their schools as an event generator, when they should.  Go on to your university's website and find the career fair, find a seminar, find a company presentation, find something that will help you learn and meet people.  You'll probably find a lot of options!
* [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com) - Meetup is a great place to find groups of people who are interested in the same things you are, who meet regularly.  Look for engineering meetups that are hosted **at** companies.  You'll get to see an office, and meet people who actually work there (in addition to those who might work at other organizations).
* [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) - Eventbrite is best for finding events that aren't recurring.  You can often find workshops, networking events, parties, and classes there.  I tend to just search for the term, "tech" or "computer" and the results simply flow.  Like a babbling brook.  Or something.
* [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/) - MLH provides a fairly thorough schedule of university hackathons every semester.  Most of the events on their schedule provide travel reimbursement, but there's so many that you'll likely find one near you!
* [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/) - Lanyrd is a "social conference directory" that is full of conferences based on almost any topic.  Follow your favorite speakers or search for a particular language or technology, and you'll be set.

Like I mentioned before, there's a lot of resources out there for finding events.  Now that you have places to go to, what do you do there?
WHAT A CLEVER SEGUE.

## Networking

The whole point of going to events (besides learning something, of course) is to network.  Meeting and maintaining relationships with people in this industry is essential.

So, how **do** you just network with people?  How do you make it as natural as eating pie on Pi Day?  I'll show you, Bert.

First of all, don't think of it as networking.  You don't want to get the heebie-jeebies.  Think of it as meeting people who like what you like.  When you're at these events, you'll occasionally see groups of people staying in their own groups, not often reaching out to others.  You're not going to do that.  You're going to be a professional, social butterfly.

Follow generally these steps (as casually or formally as the event calls for) when networking:

1. Introduce yourself.  This seems obvious, but you'd be surprised how often people just sort of slide into a conversation without ever actually providing anyone with their name or title.  Go up to people and tell them who you are.

2. Make small talk about tech.  Again, an obvious tip, but important.  You want to know what this person's skills are, and you want them to know yours.  Someday, they might be looking for someone to help them on a project in a language that you know, or vice-versa.  Get the important details out in the open about each other so that not only you can remember each other, but you can help each other out in the future.  And don't forget to have fun with it!

3. Exchange contact information.  If you have no way of finding the person you're talking to again, and they don't have a way of finding you, then you're just wasting a potentially valuable connection.  Whether you give them a business card or an email address, or even a Twitter handle, keep that information!

4. Follow-up.  This is probably **the most important thing I will tell you in this whole guide.**  Hence the bold letters.  So pretty.  Anyway.  Following up is the guaranteed way of leaving an impression with someone.  Whether you email or tweet or InMail or Facebook message or pigeon mail, just sending a simple, "it was nice to meet you!" message is absolutely **vital** when it comes to networking.  I've actually heard stories of people changing their mind about hiring someone based on a follow-up message.  And following up doesn't stop at the "nice to meet you" message.  At some point down the line, it's great practice to send a "how are you doing?" message to someone you're interested in maintaining a relationship with.  For all three of my mentors that I had in college (and to this day), the way we built our relationship was through these sorts of follow-up messages.  **Do them.**

Networking is about building relationships, and what you can do with those relationships is up to you.  But we're talking about getting a job.  So let's move on to one of the best ways of getting one, with these relationships.

## Referrals

Referrals are your in.  If you can get a referral from an employee of the company you're applying for, that's money.  It pushes you towards the top of the pile of resumes that they're getting every single day.  Using the relationships you've built from networking, all it takes is a simple ask!  You can get a referral from current employees, former ones, interns, former interns, friends of engineers, acquaintances of recruiters... really, anyone who is connected with the company.  If they have a job posting up for a given position, they are looking around for engineers just as much as you're looking around for a great gig!  The company knows that they're going to be speaking with someone potentially really good (because they were recommended by someone trusted), and you get to speak to a company for whom you want to work.  Having a referral is a win for both parties.  

Asking for a referral really depends on your relationship with the referrer.  If you know them in a strictly business setting, you might want to send them a more professional request.  But if you know the referrer pretty well, chances are you know how to ask for a favor.  One thing that you must remember though is to, again, **follow up**!  If you haven't heard back from your referrer, reach out and check on your status.  If they let you know that you're in the system, be gracious and take them for coffee or something.  Common courtesy.  You've got this.

## Cold Calling

A lot of people are fans of cold calling, which is making unsolicited contact with a person at a company and hoping for something good to come of it.  I admit, I'm not one of those people.  Seems spammy.  But, I'll tell you about some ways to do that anyway, to make your cold calls as potentially successful as possible.

First of all, you should have an email for someone at the company you're looking at.  You could ask around your network for contact information for a given person, or you could just go out on a limb and [test some emails to see if they're valid](http://mailtester.com/).  A lot of companies have fairly standard email address templates (firstname.lastname@company.com, for example), so you can just keep sending a few until you find a legitimate one.  If you need names to test out, you can scour LinkedIn or the company's website to try and find something that works.

Once you have a legitimate email on your hands, get to work on making a personalized message to them.  Emphasis on the personal.  When you're cold calling, you can't have just any standard email template where you stick in the company's name where it fits.  You have to clearly let the person know why you're writing, from where you got their information (if it's not just a random guess, of course), why you would be a good fit for the company (where you will **sell** those awesome skills of yours), and why you think the company is great.  Essentially, you're writing a glorified cover letter.

When the email has been sent, you're done.  If you haven't heard back in a week or two, send a follow-up, but if they still haven't replied after that, chances are they won't reply at all.  And that's okay.  It happens.  That's the territory when it comes to cold calling.

## Fellowships

Fellowships are a great way to network with a community and get valuable mentorship that will most certainly help you in the long run.  They vary depending on the program, but typically you'll get assigned a mentor or two, go to several events to network with professionals, and intern for a company that has partnered with the specific fellowship program.

Here's a list of some example fellowship programs.  This is by no means a complete list (feel free to send a pull request or file an issue if there's another you'd like to be added), but it should get you started!

* [Cansbridge Fellowship](http://www.cansbridgefellowship.com/)
* [CODE2040](http://code2040.org/)
* [FirstMark Elite](http://firstmarkelite.com/)
* [First Round Capital](http://www.university.firstround.com/)
* [Ford-Mozilla Fellows](https://advocacy.mozilla.org/open-web-fellows/)
* [hackNY Fellows](http://apply.hackny.org/)
* [Knight-Mozilla Fellows](http://opennews.org/fellowships/)
* [KPCB Fellows](http://kpcbfellows.com/)
* [Mayfield Fellows Program](http://stvp.stanford.edu/mayfield-fellows-program/)
* [NYC Turing Fellows](http://nycturingfellows.org/)
* [PennApps Fellows](http://www.pennappsfellows.com/)
* [True Entrepreneur Corps](http://www.trueventures.com/tec/)

In addition to these fellowships, several companies offer special programs for younger students that are similarly geared towards learning and mentorship.  Here's another list that is not complete, but will get you started:

* [Microsoft Explore](http://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/us/university-programs.aspx) (I'm biased because I did this one, but this program is AWESOME)
* [Google Engineering Practicum](https://www.google.com/jobs/students/engpracticum)
* [Facebook University of Engineering](https://www.facebook.com/careers/university/fbueng)
* [Intel IRISE](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/jobs/locations/united-states/students/internships/intel-early-internship-software-engineering.html)
* [Qualcomm EIP (Early Identification Program)](https://www.qualcomm.com/company/careers/interns)
* [Pinterest Engage Software Engineer Intern] (https://careers.pinterest.com/careers/details/pinterest-engage-software-engineer-intern_san-francisco_143952)

o overboard and brag.  Just be honest, and confident.

# Your Search

You have a resume and cover letter in hand, and you have the skills to make anyone want you.  Now, you just have to find the right gig for you.

## Events

When you're on the hunt for a great internship or first job, the events you go to can really set you apart, and will help you meet people that could potentially help you in the long run.

The biggies that you will definitely run into are:

* Hackathons
* Meetups
* Conferences
* Career Fairs

So, how do you find these events?  They're happening all the time, you just need to know where to look.  Firstly, ask people in the field.  Talk to a mentor, a fellow student, a professor, a colleague... anyone could come through for you!  I remember my first tech event I went to in college was because I ran into a guy that I met orientation day.  And now he and I are coworkers.  Fancy that.  Anyway, people can get you very far.

Otherwise, when people don't work, we always have the glorious internet leading the way.  There's so many resources out there I definitely can't list them all.  So I'll list just a few.

* Your School - Yeah, this is kind of an easy shot, but not a lot of people consider their schools as an event generator, when they should.  Go on to your university's website and find the career fair, find a seminar, find a company presentation, find something that will help you learn and meet people.  You'll probably find a lot of options!
* [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com) - Meetup is a great place to find groups of people who are interested in the same things you are, who meet regularly.  Look for engineering meetups that are hosted **at** companies.  You'll get to see an office, and meet people who actually work there (in addition to those who might work at other organizations).
* [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) - Eventbrite is best for finding events that aren't recurring.  You can often find workshops, networking events, parties, and classes there.  I tend to just search for the term, "tech" or "computer" and the results simply flow.  Like a babbling brook.  Or something.
* [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/) - MLH provides a fairly thorough schedule of university hackathons every semester.  Most of the events on their schedule provide travel reimbursement, but there's so many that you'll likely find one near you!
* [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/) - Lanyrd is a "social conference directory" that is full of conferences based on almost any topic.  Follow your favorite speakers or search for a particular language or technology, and you'll be set.

Like I mentioned before, there's a lot of resources out there for finding events.  Now that you have places to go to, what do you do there?
WHAT A CLEVER SEGUE.

#### Snippet of the Day:


---
### Fibonacci in Python:

```py
def fib_iter(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    p0 = 0
    p1 = 1
    for i in range(n-1):
        next_val = p0 + p1
        p0 = p1
        p1 = next_val
    return next_val
for i in range(10):
    print(f'{i}: {fib_iter(i)}')
```

 #### Yesterday's Snippet of the day:

---

```py
def quicksort(l):
    # One of our base cases is an empty list or list with one element
    if len(l) == 0 or len(l) == 1:
        return l
    # If we have a left list, a pivot point and a right list...
    # assigns the return values of the partition() function
    left, pivot, right = partition(l) 
    # Our sorted list looks like left + pivot + right, but sorted.
    # Pivot has to be in brackets to be a list, so python can concatenate all the elements to a single list
    return quicksort(left) + [pivot] + quicksort(right)
# print(quicksort([]))
# print(quicksort([1]))
# print(quicksort([1,2]))
# print(quicksort([2,1]))
# print(quicksort([2,2]))
# print(quicksort([5,3,9,4,8,1,7]))
# print(quicksort([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]))
# print(quicksort([9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]))

###  Node Cheat Sheet

```js
/*************************
 * //NODE-JS-CHEAT-SHEET *
 *************************/

/* *******************************************************************************************
* GLOBAL OBJECTS
* http://nodejs.org/api/globals.html
* ******************************************************************************************* */
// In browsers, the top-level scope is the global scope.
// That means that in browsers if you're in the global scope var something will define a global variable.
// In Node this is different. The top-level scope is not the global scope; var something inside a Node module will be local to that module.
__filename;  // The filename of the code being executed. (absolute path)
__dirname;   // The name of the directory that the currently executing script resides in. (absolute path)
module;      // A reference to the current module. In particular module.exports is used for defining what a module exports and makes available through require().
exports;     // A reference to the module.exports that is shorter to type.
process;     // The process object is a global object and can be accessed from anywhere. It is an instance of EventEmitter.
Buffer;      // The Buffer class is a global type for dealing with binary data directly.

* MODULES
* http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html

process.memoryUsage();                // Returns an object describing the memory usage of the Node process measured in bytes.
process.nextTick(callback);           // On the next loop around the event loop call this callback.
process.maxTickDepth;                 // Callbacks passed to process.nextTick will usually be called at the end of the current flow of execution, and are thus approximately as fast as calling a function synchronously.
process.umask([mask]);                // Sets or reads the process's file mode creation mask.
process.uptime();                     // Number of seconds Node has been running.

child.disconnect();                                           // Close the IPC channel between parent and child, allowing the child to exit gracefully once there are no other connections keeping it alive.
child_process.spawn(command, [args], [options]);              // Launches a new process with the given command, with command line arguments in args. If omitted, args defaults to an empty Array.
child_process.exec(command, [options], callback);             // Runs a command in a shell and buffers the output.
child_process.execFile(file, [args], [options], [callback]);  // Runs a command in a shell and buffers the output.
child_process.fork(modulePath, [args], [options]);            // This is a special case of the spawn() functionality for spawning Node processes. In addition to having all the methods in a normal ChildProcess instance, the returned object has a communication channel built-in. 
* UTIL
* http://nodejs.org/api/util.html
// These functions are in the module 'util'. Use require('util') to access them.
util.format(format, [...]);    // Returns a formatted string using the first argument as a printf-like format. (%s, %d, %j)
util.debug(string);            // A synchronous output function. Will block the process and output string immediately to stderr.

util.print([...]);             // A synchronous output function. Will block the process, cast each argument to a string then output to stdout. (no newlines)
util.log(string);              // Output with timestamp on stdout.
util.inspect(object, [opts]);  // Return a string representation of object, which is useful for debugging. (options: showHidden, depth, colors, customInspect)

* EVENTS
* http://nodejs.org/api/events.html
// All objects which emit events are instances of events.EventEmitter. You can access this module by doing: require("events");
// To access the EventEmitter class, require('events').EventEmitter.
// All EventEmitters emit the event 'newListener' when new listeners are added and 'removeListener' when a listener is removed.
emitter.addListener(event, listener);        // Adds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event.
emitter.on(event, listener);                 // Same as emitter.addListener().
emitter.once(event, listener);               // Adds a one time listener for the event. This listener is invoked only the next time the event is fired, after which it is removed.
emitter.removeListener(event, listener);     // Remove a listener from the listener array for the specified event.
emitter.removeAllListeners([event]);         // Removes all listeners, or those of the specified event.
emitter.setMaxListeners(n);                  // By default EventEmitters will print a warning if more than 10 listeners are added for a particular event.
emitter.listeners(event);                    // Returns an array of listeners for the specified event.
emitter.emit(event, [arg1], [arg2], [...]);  // Execute each of the listeners in order with the supplied arguments. Returns true if event had listeners, false otherwise.
EventEmitter.listenerCount(emitter, event);  // Return the number of listeners for a given event.
* STREAM
* http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html
// A stream is an abstract interface implemented by various objects in Node. For example a request to an HTTP server is a stream, as is stdout.
// Streams are readable, writable, or both. All streams are instances of EventEmitter.
// The Readable stream interface is the abstraction for a source of data that you are reading from.
// In other words, data comes out of a Readable stream.
// A Readable stream will not start emitting data until you indicate that you are ready to receive it.
// Examples of readable streams include: http responses on the client, http requests on the server, fs read streams
// zlib streams, crypto streams, tcp sockets, child process stdout and stderr, process.stdin.
var readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
readable.on('readable', function() {});   // When a chunk of data can be read from the stream, it will emit a 'readable' event.
readable.on('data', function(chunk) {});  // If you attach a data event listener, then it will switch the stream into flowing mode, and data will be passed to your handler as soon as it is available.
readable.on('end', function() {});        // This event fires when there will be no more data to read.
readable.on('close', function() {});      // Emitted when the underlying resource (for example, the backing file descriptor) has been closed. Not all streams will emit this.
readable.on('error', function() {});      // Emitted if there was an error receiving data.
// The read() method pulls some data out of the internal buffer and returns it. If there is no data available, then it will return null.
// This method should only be called in non-flowing mode. In flowing-mode, this method is called automatically until the internal buffer is drained.
readable.read([size]);
readable.setEncoding(encoding);           // Call this function to cause the stream to return strings of the specified encoding instead of Buffer objects.
readable.resume();                        // This method will cause the readable stream to resume emitting data events.
readable.pause();                         // This method will cause a stream in flowing-mode to stop emitting data events.
readable.pipe(destination, [options]);    // This method pulls all the data out of a readable stream, and writes it to the supplied destination, automatically managing the flow so that the destination is not overwhelmed by a fast readable stream.
readable.unpipe([destination]);           // This method will remove the hooks set up for a previous pipe() call. If the destination is not specified, then all pipes are removed.
readable.unshift(chunk);                  // This is useful in certain cases where a stream is being consumed by a parser, which needs to "un-consume" some data that it has optimistically pulled out of the source, so that the stream can be passed on to some other party.
// The Writable stream interface is an abstraction for a destination that you are writing data to.
// Examples of writable streams include: http requests on the client, http responses on the server, fs write streams,
// zlib streams, crypto streams, tcp sockets, child process stdin, process.stdout, process.stderr.
var writer = getWritableStreamSomehow();
writable.write(chunk, [encoding], [callback]);  // This method writes some data to the underlying system, and calls the supplied callback once the data has been fully handled.
writer.once('drain', write);                    // If a writable.write(chunk) call returns false, then the drain event will indicate when it is appropriate to begin writing more data to the stream.
writable.end([chunk], [encoding], [callback]);  // Call this method when no more data will be written to the stream.
writer.on('finish', function() {});             // When the end() method has been called, and all data has been flushed to the underlying system, this event is emitted.
writer.on('pipe', function(src) {});            // This is emitted whenever the pipe() method is called on a readable stream, adding this writable to its set of destinations.
writer.on('unpipe', function(src) {});          // This is emitted whenever the unpipe() method is called on a readable stream, removing this writable from its set of destinations.
writer.on('error', function(src) {});           // Emitted if there was an error when writing or piping data.
// Duplex streams are streams that implement both the Readable and Writable interfaces. See above for usage.
// Examples of Duplex streams include: tcp sockets, zlib streams, crypto streams.
// Transform streams are Duplex streams where the output is in some way computed from the input. They implement both the Readable and Writable interfaces. See above for usage.
// Examples of Transform streams include: zlib streams, crypto streams.

assert(value, message); assert.ok(value, [message]);  // Tests if value is truthy, it is equivalent to assert.equal(true, !!value, message);
assert.equal(actual, expected, [message]);            // Tests shallow, coercive equality with the equal comparison operator ( == ).
assert.notEqual(actual, expected, [message]);         // Tests shallow, coercive non-equality with the not equal comparison operator ( != ).
assert.deepEqual(actual, expected, [message]);        // Tests for deep equality.
assert.notDeepEqual(actual, expected, [message]);     // Tests for any deep inequality.
assert.strictEqual(actual, expected, [message]);      // Tests strict equality, as determined by the strict equality operator ( === )
assert.notStrictEqual(actual, expected, [message]);   // Tests strict non-equality, as determined by the strict not equal operator ( !== )
assert.throws(block, [error], [message]);             // Expects block to throw an error. error can be constructor, RegExp or validation function.
assert.doesNotThrow(block, [message]);                // Expects block not to throw an error, see assert.throws for details.
assert.ifError(value);                                // Tests if value is not a false value, throws if it is a true value. Useful when testing the first argument, error in callbacks.
* OS
* http://nodejs.org/api/os.html
// Provides a few basic operating-system related utility functions.
// Use require('os') to access this module.
os.tmpdir();             // Returns the operating system's default directory for temp files.
os.endianness();         // Returns the endianness of the CPU. Possible values are "BE" or "LE".
os.hostname();           // Returns the hostname of the operating system.
os.type();               // Returns the operating system name.
os.platform();           // Returns the operating system platform.
os.arch();               // Returns the operating system CPU architecture.
os.release();            // Returns the operating system release.
os.uptime();             // Returns the system uptime in seconds.
os.loadavg();            // Returns an array containing the 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages.
os.totalmem();           // Returns the total amount of system memory in bytes.
os.freemem();            // Returns the amount of free system memory in bytes.
os.cpus();               // Returns an array of objects containing information about each CPU/core installed: model, speed (in MHz), and times (an object containing the number of milliseconds the CPU/core spent in: user, nice, sys, idle, and irq).
os.networkInterfaces();  // Get a list of network interfaces.
os.EOL;                  // A constant defining the appropriate End-of-line marker for the operating system.
* BUFFER
* http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html
// Buffer is used to dealing with binary data
// Buffer is similar to an array of integers but corresponds to a raw memory allocation outside the V8 heap
Buffer.from(size);                                                  // Allocates a new buffer of size octets.
Buffer.from(array);                                                 // Allocates a new buffer using an array of octets.
Buffer.from(str, [encoding]);                                       // Allocates a new buffer containing the given str. encoding defaults to 'utf8'.
Buffer.isEncoding(encoding);                                        // Returns true if the encoding is a valid encoding argument, or false otherwise.
Buffer.isBuffer(obj);                                               // Tests if obj is a Buffer
Buffer.concat(list, [totalLength]);                                 // Returns a buffer which is the result of concatenating all the buffers in the list together.
Buffer.byteLength(string, [encoding]);                              // Gives the actual byte length of a string.
buf.write(string, [offset], [length], [encoding]);                  // Writes string to the buffer at offset using the given encoding
buf.toString([encoding], [start], [end]);                           // Decodes and returns a string from buffer data encoded with encoding (defaults to 'utf8') beginning at start (defaults to 0) and ending at end (defaults to buffer.length).
buf.toJSON();                                                       // Returns a JSON-representation of the Buffer instance, which is identical to the output for JSON Arrays
buf.copy(targetBuffer, [targetStart], [sourceStart], [sourceEnd]);  // Does copy between buffers. The source and target regions can be overlapped
buf.slice([start], [end]);                                          // Returns a new buffer which references the same memory as the old, but offset and cropped by the start (defaults to 0) and end (defaults to buffer.length) indexes. Negative indexes start from the end of the buffer.   
buf.fill(value, [offset], [end]);                                   // Fills the buffer with the specified value
buf[index];                                                         // Get and set the octet at index
buf.length;                                                         // The size of the buffer in bytes, Note that this is not necessarily the size of the contents
buffer.INSPECT_MAX_BYTES;                                           // How many bytes will be returned when buffer.inspect() is called. This can be overridden by user modules.

## ➤ Installation

```javascript
npm install @appnest/readme -D
```

If you don't want to install anything you can use the `npx @appnest/readme generate` command instead.

[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#getting-started-quick)

## ➤ Getting Started (quick)

This getting started guide is super quick! Follow these two steps and you will have turned your boring readme into a pretty one.

1. Rename your current `README.md` file to `blueprint.md`.
2. Run `npx @appnest/readme generate`

That's it! Check out your freshly generated `README.md` file and enjoy the fruits of what you just did.


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#getting-started-slower)

## ➤ Getting Started (slower)

This getting started guide is a little bit longer, but will give you some superpowers. Spend a minute reading this getting started guide and you'll have the best README file in your town very soon.

### Blueprint

First you need to create a `blueprint.md` file. This blueprint is going to be the blueprint for the `README.md` file we will generate later.

Let's start simple. In order to get values from your `package.json` file injected into the README file we use the mustache syntax (`{{ .. }}`). Let's say your `package.json` file looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "@appnest/readme",
  "version": "1.2.5"
}
```

To get the `name` and `version` into your README file you will need to write `{{ pkg.name }}` and `{{ pkg.version }}` in your `blueprint.md` file like this:

```markdown
Welcome to {{ pkg.name }}. This is version {{ pkg.version }}!
```

When running `node_modules/.bin/readme generate` the file `README.md` will be generated with the following contents:

```markdown
Welcome to @appnest/readme. This is version 1.2.5.
```

### Usage

Run the `node_modules/.bin/readme generate` command and a README file will be generated for you. If you want to go into depth with the readme command, check out the following options or write `node_modules/.bin/readme generate -h` in your terminal if that's your cup of tea.

### Configuration

To configure this library you'll need to create a `blueprint.json` file. This file is the configuration for the templates we are going to take a look at in the next section. If you want to interpolate values from the configuration file into your README file you can simply reference them without a scope. Eg. if you have the field "link" in your `blueprint.json` you can write `{{ link }}` to reference it.

Great. Now that we have the basics covered, let's continue and see how you can use templates!

[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#templates)

## ➤ Templates

If you have come this far you are probably interested to figure out how to use README templates. This library comes with a set of pre-defined templates to make your readme awesome, but you can of course create your own. More about that later, let's not get ahead of our self just yet.

### Title

Let's start with the title template. To generate the title you write `{{ template:title }}` in your blueprint. When you run the `readme` command the template will generate the following:

<h1 align="center">@appnest/readme</h1>

The important thing to note here is that the template automatically reads your `package.json` file and inserts the `name` from the package.

```json
{
  "name": "@appnest/readme"
}
```

That's cool. Let's go through some of the other built-in templates you might want to add.

### Logo

The logo template adds a logo to your readme and looks like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/logo-shadow.png" alt="Logo" width="150" height="150" />
</p>

Use the placeholder `{{ template:logo }}` to stamp it. You will need to add the `logo` field to your `blueprint.json`. The logo field requires an `src` field. Optionally you can provide values for `width`, `height` and `alt`. Below is an example on how to add the data for the logo template.

```json
{
  "logo": {
    "src": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/logo-shadow.png",
    "width": "150"
  }
}
```

### Badges

The badges template adds badges to your readme and looks like this:

<p align="center">
		<a href="https://npmcharts.com/compare/@appnest/readme?minimal=true"><img alt="Downloads per month" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@appnest/readme.svg" height="20"/></a>
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@appnest/readme"><img alt="NPM Version" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@appnest/readme.svg" height="20"/></a>
<a href="https://david-dm.org/andreasbm/readme"><img alt="Dependencies" src="https://img.shields.io/david/andreasbm/readme.svg" height="20"/></a>
<a href="https://github.com/andreasbm/readme/graphs/contributors"><img alt="Contributors" src="https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/andreasbm/readme.svg" height="20"/></a>
<a href="https://github.com/badges/shields"><img alt="Custom badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/custom-badge-f39f37.svg" height="20"/></a>
<a href="https://github.com/andreasbm/readme/graphs/commit-activity"><img alt="Maintained" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintained%3F-yes-green.svg" height="20"/></a>
	</p>


Use the `{{ template:badges }}` placeholder to stamp it. You will need to add the data about how the badges should be generated. For that you can extend the `ids` property in your `blueprint.json` and add the `npm` and `github` ids (both are optional). If you want to add your own badges you can use the `badges` field.

```json
{
  "ids": {
    "github": "andreasbm/readme",
    "npm": "@appnest/readme"
  },
  "badges": [
    {
      "alt": "Custom badge",
      "url": "https://github.com/badges/shields",
      "img": "https://img.shields.io/badge/custom-badge-f39f37.svg"
    }
  ]
}
```

If you need some inspiration for badges, check [this website](https://shields.io/) out.

### Description

The description template adds a description to your readme and looks like this:

<p align="center">
  <b>Automatically generate a beautiful best-practice README file based on the contents of your repository</b></br>
  <sub>Use this readme generator to easily generate beautiful readme's like this one! Simply extend your <code>package.json</code> and create a readme blueprint. On Github, the README file is like the landing page of your website because it is the first thing visitors see. You want to make a good first impression.<sub>
</p>

<br />


Use the `{{ template:description }}` placeholder to stamp it. To use this template you are required to add the field `description` to your `package.json` file. Optionally you can also add the fields `text` and `demo` in your `blueprint.json` file which will be presented below the description.

// package.json

```json
{
  "description": "Automatically generate a beautiful best-practice README file based on the contents of your repository"
}
```

// blueprint.json

```json
{
  "text": "Use this readme generator to easily generate beautiful readme's like this one! Simply extend your <code>package.json</code> and create a readme blueprint. On Github, the README file is like the landing page of your website because it is the first thing visitors see. You want to make a good first impression."
}
```

### Table of Contents

The table of contents template adds a table of contents and looks like this:


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#table-of-contents)

* [➤ License](#-license-1)

Use the `{{ template:toc }}` placeholder to stamp it. It has been scientifically proven that this template will save you approximately 392.3 hours during your life-time. Seriously.

### Contributors

The contributors template adds the list of contributors and looks like this:


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#contributors)

## ➤ Contributors
	

| [<img alt="Andreas Mehlsen" src="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6267397?s=460&v=4" width="100">](https://twitter.com/andreasmehlsen) | [<img alt="You?" src="https://joeschmoe.io/api/v1/random" width="100">](https://github.com/andreasbm/readme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) |
|:--------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------:|
| [Andreas Mehlsen](https://twitter.com/andreasmehlsen) | [You?](https://github.com/andreasbm/readme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) |
| 🔥                                               |                                                  |


Use the `{{ template:contributors }}` placeholder to stamp it. Let's sa To use this template your are required to add the `contributors` array to your `package.json` file like this. Only the `name` field is required.

```json
{
  "contributors": [
    {
      "name": "Andreas Mehlsen",
      "email": "hello@example.com",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/andreasmehlsen",
      "img": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6267397?s=460&v=4",
      "info": [
        "🔥"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "You?",
      "img": "https://joeschmoe.io/api/v1/random",
      "url": "https://github.com/andreasbm/readme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

Take note of the `info` array. That one is really exciting! Here you can add lines describing the contributors - for example the role of accomplishments. Take a look [here](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for more inspiration of what you could put into the info array.

### License

The license template adds a license section and looks like this:


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#license)

## ➤ License
	
Licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Use the `{{ template:license }}` placeholder to stamp it. To use this template you are required to add the `license` field to your `package.json` file like this.

```json
{
  "license": "license"
}
```



[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#load-markdown-files)

## ➤ Load markdown files

What? You heard right. You can split the contents of your readme into multiple different files to make your life easier. Let's say you have a file called `my-section.md`. To stamp it you'll need to add `{{ load:my-section.md }}`.

[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#automatic-documentation)

## ➤ Automatic documentation

Welcome to the future. Here we have **automatic documentation of web components!**. Let's say you have the following web component inside a file called `my-button.js`.

```javascript
/**
 * Button used for clicking!
 * @slot - Default content
 */
export class MyButton extends HTMLElement {

  /**
   * Attributes being observed.
   * @returns {string[]}
   */
  static get observedAttributes() {
    return ["disabled", "role"];
  }
  
  /**
   * Disables the element.
   * @attr
   * @type {boolean}
   */
  disabled = false;

  /**
   * Role of the element.
   * @attr
   * @type {string}
   */
  role = "button";
}

customElements.define("my-button", MyButton);
```

Then you can get automatic documentation for the web component by simply writing `{{ doc:my-button.js }}` which will result in the following content.


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#my-button)

## ➤ my-button

Button used for clicking!

### Properties

| Property   | Attribute  | Type      | Default  | Description           |
|------------|------------|-----------|----------|-----------------------|
| `disabled` | `disabled` | `boolean` | false    | Disables the element. |
| `role`     | `role`     | `string`  | "button" | Role of the element.  |

### Slots

| Name | Description     |
|------|-----------------|
|      | Default content |

[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#a-bit-about-this-readme)

## ➤ A bit about this readme

By now you are probably curious to know how this README file was generated? It was created from the following `blueprint.md` file.

```markdown
{{ template:logo }}
{{ template:title }}
{{ template:badges }}
{{ template:description }}
{{ bullets }}
{{ template:toc }}
{{ load:readme/1-installation.md }}
{{ load:readme/2-getting-started.md }}
{{ load:readme/3-templates.md }}
{{ load:readme/4-load-markdown.md }}
{{ load:readme/5-automatic-documentation.md }}
{{ load:readme/6-this-readme.md }}
{{ load:readme/7-custom-templates.md }}
{{ load:readme/8-advanced.md }}
{{ load:readme/9-featured-readmes.md }}
{{ load:readme/10-future-work.md }}
{{ load:readme/11-faq.md }}
{{ template:contributors }}
{{ template:license }}
```

It really couldn't be more simple that this.

[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#custom-templates)

## ➤ Custom templates

You are able to create your own templates to keep things as DRY as a hot summer day. To create your own templates you'll first need to add the `templates` array to your `blueprint.json` file like this.

```json
{
  "templates": [
    {
      "name": "install",
      "template": "Run `npm install {{ ids.npm }} to install this library!"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then you can stamp your custom template using the `{{ template:install }}` syntax ("install" here referencing the name of the custom template). The below is an example of what is stamped to the README file using the above template.

Run `npm install @appnest/readme' to install this library!

Be creative! You can for example add a template for code-snippets or [words you keep spelling wrong](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/spelling/common-misspellings).

[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#advanced)

## ➤ Advanced!

Oh! So are you ready to open Pandora's box? Let's do it.

### Check broken links

Add the `checkLinks` field to your `blueprint.json` and you'll be notified about all broken links in your README file. This check use [check-links](https://www.npmjs.com/package/check-links) to check links for aliveness.

```json
{
  "checkLinks": true
}
```

### New template syntax

If you are in the mood you can change the syntax used for matching with the templates. Let's say you want your placeholders to look like this instead `{[ template:title }]`. Then you'll need to add the `placeholder` array to your `blueprint.json` file with the new syntax being `["{[", "}]"]` like this.


```json
{
  "placeholder": ["{[", "}]"]
}
```

### Variables

If you have a variable from your `blueprint.json` file you want to stamp to your README file just use the `{{ ... }}` syntax as usual without any scopes.

#### Objects

Objects are formatted as a list with the keys being bold. If you for example want to stamp the `dependencies` field from your `package.json` file you write `{{ pkg.dependencies }}` and the dependencies will be stamped in a nice formatted way like this.

* **@types/glob**: ^7.1.1
* **check-links**: ^1.1.8
* **colors**: ^1.4.0
* **commander**: ^5.0.0
* **fs-extra**: ^9.0.0
* **glob**: ^7.1.6
* **path**: ^0.12.7
* **web-component-analyzer**: 1.0.3

#### 1D Arrays

If you have a 1D array it will be formatted as a list. If you for example want to stamp the the `keywords` field from your `package.json` file you write `{{ pkg.keywords }}` and the keywords will be stamped in a nice formatted way like this:

* opensource
* project
* readme
* template
* boilerplate
* nodejs
* maintaining
* generator

#### 2D Arrays

If you have a 2D array it will be formatted as a table. This is very convenient for things like documentation of API's. Let's say you have the following in your `blueprint.json`.

```json
{
  "properties": [
    ["Attribute", "Type", "Description"],
    ["**size**", "'medium', 'large'", "Determines the size" ],
    ["**active**", "boolean", "Whether the element is active or not" ]
  ]
}
```

Then you can stamp it to your readme by writing `{{ properties }}` and it will be formatted as a table.


| Attribute  | Type              | Description                          |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **size**   | 'medium', 'large' | Determines the size                  |
| **active** | boolean           | Whether the element is active or not |


You are welcome!

### Different colored lines

If you want to change the color of the lines above headers you can change the `line` field in the `blueprint.json`. Here's an example if you want a dark line instead of the colored one.

```json
{
  "line": "dark"
}
```

The following is the dark variant of the line.

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/dark.png)

Yeah! Dark mode on your `README.md` is awesome indeed. You have other options besides dark mode. Here's all the line styles you can choose from.

* "aqua" ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/aqua.png)
* "cloudy" ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/cloudy.png)

* "water" ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/water.png)

If you want your own line design you can give the `line` field an url to an image instead. It is recommended that this image is 900px in width. If you prefer no line at all you can give the `line` field the string "none".

### Different formatted headings

If you want to change the prefix in front of the heading you can change the `headingPrefix` in the `blueprint.json` file. Just map the heading level to the desired prefix as shown below.

```json
{
  "headingPrefix": {
    "1": "➜ ",
    "2": "⭑ "
  }
}
```

If you want some inspiration for symbols you can put infront of the headings you can check out [this](https://unicodes.smpc.io/) website.

## ➤ Featured README's

If you use this generator for one of your projects I would love to hear about it so I can feature it. Here's a list of some repositories using this generator for their README file.

* [lit-translate](https://github.com/andreasbm/lit-translate)
* [masonry-layout](https://github.com/andreasbm/masonry-layout)
* [focus-trap](https://github.com/andreasbm/focus-trap)
* [web-router](https://github.com/andreasbm/web-router)
* [web-config](https://github.com/andreasbm/web-config)
* [ts-lit-plugin](https://github.com/runem/ts-lit-plugin)
* [blob](https://github.com/andreasbm/blob)

As inspiration for the layout of the generated README files I initially found inspiration from [terkelg's brilliant repository called prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts) - a prime example on how every README file should look! I therefore wanted to mention him here even though he doesn't use this README generator. If you want to see an example of a brilliant README file you should definitely check his repository out.


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#future-work)

## ➤ Future work

That's it for now! Lot's of exiting features a going to be added in the future. If you stumble upon an issue or have a feature request you are very welcome to open a Github issue or pull request. Have a great day!


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#faq)

## ➤ FAQ

### Can I see how my README file is going to look before I commit it?

Yes you definitely can! There are lots of tools out there for editing/previewing Github flavored markdown. I recommend using [https://stackedit.io/app](https://stackedit.io/app) to preview the final result since it is super lightweight and does it job well.

### How can I get involved?

Create an issue or pull-request. You are also very welcome to throw me a message at [@AndreasMehlsen](https://twitter.com/andreasmehlsen).

### I already have a large README file - I don't have time to rewrite everything!

No problem at all! Your first step can be to rename your `README.md` to `blueprint.md` and run `node_modules/.bin/readme generate`. Already then your README should now be well-formatted. Then you can slowly replace the contents when you have time. The low-hanging fruit would be to add the table of contents and license using respectively the `{{ template:toc }}` and `{{ template:license }}` templates.

### How can I support you?

There are lot's of ways to support me! I would be so happy if you gave this repository a star, tweeted about it or told your friends about this little corner of the Internet ❤️

# @nodelib/fs.scandir

> List files and directories inside the specified directory.

## :bulb: Highlights

The package is aimed at obtaining information about entries in the directory.

* :moneybag: Returns useful information: `name`, `path`, `dirent` and `stats` (optional).
* :gear: On Node.js 10.10+ uses the mechanism without additional calls to determine the entry type. See [`old` and `modern` mode](#old-and-modern-mode).
* :link: Can safely work with broken symbolic links.

## Install

```console
npm install @nodelib/fs.scandir
```

## Usage

```ts
import * as fsScandir from '@nodelib/fs.scandir';

fsScandir.scandir('path', (error, stats) => { /* … */ });
```

## API

### .scandir(path, [optionsOrSettings], callback)

Returns an array of plain objects ([`Entry`](#entry)) with information about entry for provided path with standard callback-style.

```ts
fsScandir.scandir('path', (error, entries) => { /* … */ });
fsScandir.scandir('path', {}, (error, entries) => { /* … */ });
fsScandir.scandir('path', new fsScandir.Settings(), (error, entries) => { /* … */ });
```

### .scandirSync(path, [optionsOrSettings])

Returns an array of plain objects ([`Entry`](#entry)) with information about entry for provided path.

```ts
const entries = fsScandir.scandirSync('path');
const entries = fsScandir.scandirSync('path', {});
const entries = fsScandir.scandirSync(('path', new fsScandir.Settings());
```

#### path

* Required: `true`
* Type: `string | Buffer | URL`

A path to a file. If a URL is provided, it must use the `file:` protocol.

#### optionsOrSettings

* Required: `false`
* Type: `Options | Settings`
* Default: An instance of `Settings` class

An [`Options`](#options) object or an instance of [`Settings`](#settingsoptions) class.

> :book: When you pass a plain object, an instance of the `Settings` class will be created automatically. If you plan to call the method frequently, use a pre-created instance of the `Settings` class.

### Settings([options])

A class of full settings of the package.

```ts
const settings = new fsScandir.Settings({ followSymbolicLinks: false });

const entries = fsScandir.scandirSync('path', settings);
```

## Entry

* `name` — The name of the entry (`unknown.txt`).
* `path` — The path of the entry relative to call directory (`root/unknown.txt`).
* `dirent` — An instance of [`fs.Dirent`](./src/types/index.ts) class. On Node.js below 10.10 will be emulated by [`DirentFromStats`](./src/utils/fs.ts) class.
* `stats` (optional) — An instance of `fs.Stats` class.

For example, the `scandir` call for `tools` directory with one directory inside:

```ts
{
	dirent: Dirent { name: 'typedoc', /* … */ },
	name: 'typedoc',
	path: 'tools/typedoc'
}
```

## Options

### stats

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Adds an instance of `fs.Stats` class to the [`Entry`](#entry).

> :book: Always use `fs.readdir` without the `withFileTypes` option. ??TODO??

### followSymbolicLinks

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Follow symbolic links or not. Call `fs.stat` on symbolic link if `true`.

### `throwErrorOnBrokenSymbolicLink`

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Throw an error when symbolic link is broken if `true` or safely use `lstat` call if `false`.

### `pathSegmentSeparator`

* Type: `string`
* Default: `path.sep`

By default, this package uses the correct path separator for your OS (`\` on Windows, `/` on Unix-like systems). But you can set this option to any separator character(s) that you want to use instead.

### `fs`

* Type: [`FileSystemAdapter`](./src/adapters/fs.ts)
* Default: A default FS methods

By default, the built-in Node.js module (`fs`) is used to work with the file system. You can replace any method with your own.

```ts
interface FileSystemAdapter {
	lstat?: typeof fs.lstat;
	stat?: typeof fs.stat;
	lstatSync?: typeof fs.lstatSync;
	statSync?: typeof fs.statSync;
	readdir?: typeof fs.readdir;
	readdirSync?: typeof fs.readdirSync;
}

const settings = new fsScandir.Settings({
	fs: { lstat: fakeLstat }
});
```

## `old` and `modern` mode

This package has two modes that are used depending on the environment and parameters of use.

### old

* Node.js below `10.10` or when the `stats` option is enabled

When working in the old mode, the directory is read first (`fs.readdir`), then the type of entries is determined (`fs.lstat` and/or `fs.stat` for symbolic links).

### modern

* Node.js 10.10+ and the `stats` option is disabled

In the modern mode, reading the directory (`fs.readdir` with the `withFileTypes` option) is combined with obtaining information about its entries. An additional call for symbolic links (`fs.stat`) is still present.

This mode makes fewer calls to the file system. It's faster.

# @nodelib/fs.walk

> A library for efficiently walking a directory recursively.

## :bulb: Highlights

* :moneybag: Returns useful information: `name`, `path`, `dirent` and `stats` (optional).
* :rocket: On Node.js 10.10+ uses the mechanism without additional calls to determine the entry type for performance reasons. See [`old` and `modern` mode](https://github.com/nodelib/nodelib/blob/master/packages/fs/fs.scandir/README.md#old-and-modern-mode).
* :gear: Built-in directories/files and error filtering system.
* :link: Can safely work with broken symbolic links.

## Install

```console
npm install @nodelib/fs.walk
```

## Usage

```ts
import * as fsWalk from '@nodelib/fs.walk';

fsWalk.walk('path', (error, entries) => { /* … */ });
```

## API

### .walk(path, [optionsOrSettings], callback)

Reads the directory recursively and asynchronously. Requires a callback function.

> :book: If you want to use the Promise API, use `util.promisify`.

```ts
fsWalk.walk('path', (error, entries) => { /* … */ });
fsWalk.walk('path', {}, (error, entries) => { /* … */ });
fsWalk.walk('path', new fsWalk.Settings(), (error, entries) => { /* … */ });
```

### .walkStream(path, [optionsOrSettings])

Reads the directory recursively and asynchronously. [Readable Stream](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams) is used as a provider.

```ts
const stream = fsWalk.walkStream('path');
const stream = fsWalk.walkStream('path', {});
const stream = fsWalk.walkStream('path', new fsWalk.Settings());
```

### .walkSync(path, [optionsOrSettings])

Reads the directory recursively and synchronously. Returns an array of entries.

```ts
const entries = fsWalk.walkSync('path');
const entries = fsWalk.walkSync('path', {});
const entries = fsWalk.walkSync('path', new fsWalk.Settings());
```

#### path

* Required: `true`
* Type: `string | Buffer | URL`

A path to a file. If a URL is provided, it must use the `file:` protocol.

#### optionsOrSettings

* Required: `false`
* Type: `Options | Settings`
* Default: An instance of `Settings` class

An [`Options`](#options) object or an instance of [`Settings`](#settings) class.

> :book: When you pass a plain object, an instance of the `Settings` class will be created automatically. If you plan to call the method frequently, use a pre-created instance of the `Settings` class.

### Settings([options])

A class of full settings of the package.

```ts
const settings = new fsWalk.Settings({ followSymbolicLinks: true });

const entries = fsWalk.walkSync('path', settings);
```

## Entry

* `name` — The name of the entry (`unknown.txt`).
* `path` — The path of the entry relative to call directory (`root/unknown.txt`).
* `dirent` — An instance of [`fs.Dirent`](./src/types/index.ts) class.
* [`stats`] — An instance of `fs.Stats` class.

## Options

### basePath

* Type: `string`
* Default: `undefined`

By default, all paths are built relative to the root path. You can use this option to set custom root path.

In the example below we read the files from the `root` directory, but in the results the root path will be `custom`.

```ts
fsWalk.walkSync('root'); // → ['root/file.txt']
fsWalk.walkSync('root', { basePath: 'custom' }); // → ['custom/file.txt']
```

### concurrency

* Type: `number`
* Default: `Infinity`

The maximum number of concurrent calls to `fs.readdir`.

> :book: The higher the number, the higher performance and the load on the File System. If you want to read in quiet mode, set the value to `4 * os.cpus().length` (4 is default size of [thread pool work scheduling](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/threadpool.html#thread-pool-work-scheduling)).

### deepFilter

* Type: [`DeepFilterFunction`](./src/settings.ts)
* Default: `undefined`

A function that indicates whether the directory will be read deep or not.

```ts
// Skip all directories that starts with `node_modules`
const filter: DeepFilterFunction = (entry) => !entry.path.startsWith('node_modules');
```

### entryFilter

* Type: [`EntryFilterFunction`](./src/settings.ts)
* Default: `undefined`

A function that indicates whether the entry will be included to results or not.

```ts
// Exclude all `.js` files from results
const filter: EntryFilterFunction = (entry) => !entry.name.endsWith('.js');
```

### errorFilter

* Type: [`ErrorFilterFunction`](./src/settings.ts)
* Default: `undefined`

A function that allows you to skip errors that occur when reading directories.

For example, you can skip `ENOENT` errors if required:

```ts
// Skip all ENOENT errors
const filter: ErrorFilterFunction = (error) => error.code == 'ENOENT';
```

### stats

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Adds an instance of `fs.Stats` class to the [`Entry`](#entry).

> :book: Always use `fs.readdir` with additional `fs.lstat/fs.stat` calls to determine the entry type.

### followSymbolicLinks

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Follow symbolic links or not. Call `fs.stat` on symbolic link if `true`.

### `throwErrorOnBrokenSymbolicLink`

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Throw an error when symbolic link is broken if `true` or safely return `lstat` call if `false`.

### `pathSegmentSeparator`

* Type: `string`
* Default: `path.sep`

By default, this package uses the correct path separator for your OS (`\` on Windows, `/` on Unix-like systems). But you can set this option to any separator character(s) that you want to use instead.

### `fs`

* Type: `FileSystemAdapter`
* Default: A default FS methods

By default, the built-in Node.js module (`fs`) is used to work with the file system. You can replace any method with your own.

	lstatSync: typeof fs.lstatSync;
	statSync: typeof fs.statSync;
	readdir: typeof fs.readdir;
	readdirSync: typeof fs.readdirSync;
}

const settings = new fsWalk.Settings({
	fs: { lstat: fakeLstat }
});

# is [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/is.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/is)

> Type check values: `is.string('🦄') //=> true`

<img src="header.gif" width="182" align="right">


## Install

```
$ npm install @sindresorhus/is
```


## Usage

```js
const is = require('@sindresorhus/is');

is('🦄');
//=> 'string'

is(new Map());
//=> 'Map'

is.number(6);
//=> true
```

When using `is` together with TypeScript, [type guards](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#type-guards-and-differentiating-types) are being used to infer the correct type inside if-else statements.

```ts
import is from '@sindresorhus/is';

const padLeft = (value: string, padding: string | number) => {
	if (is.number(padding)) {
		// `padding` is typed as `number`
		return Array(padding + 1).join(' ') + value;
	}

	if (is.string(padding)) {
		// `padding` is typed as `string`
		return padding + value;
	}

	throw new TypeError(`Expected 'padding' to be of type 'string' or 'number', got '${is(padding)}'.`);
}

padLeft('🦄', 3);
//=> '   🦄'

padLeft('🦄', '🌈');
//=> '🌈🦄'
```


## API

### is(value)

Returns the type of `value`.

Primitives are lowercase and object types are camelcase.

Example:

- `'undefined'`
- `'null'`
- `'string'`
- `'symbol'`
- `'Array'`
- `'Function'`
- `'Object'`

Note: It will throw an error if you try to feed it object-wrapped primitives, as that's a bad practice. For example `new String('foo')`.

### is.{method}

All the below methods accept a value and returns a boolean for whether the value is of the desired type.

#### Primitives

##### .undefined(value)
##### .null(value)
##### .string(value)
##### .number(value)
##### .boolean(value)
##### .symbol(value)

#### Built-in types

##### .array(value)
##### .function(value)
##### .buffer(value)
##### .object(value)

Keep in mind that [functions are objects too](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions).

##### .numericString(value)

Returns `true` for a string that represents a number. For example, `'42'` and `'-8'`.

Note: `'NaN'` returns `false`, but `'Infinity'` and `'-Infinity'` return `true`.

##### .regExp(value)
##### .date(value)
##### .error(value)
##### .nativePromise(value)
##### .promise(value)

Returns `true` for any object with a `.then()` and `.catch()` method. Prefer this one over `.nativePromise()` as you usually want to allow userland promise implementations too.

##### .generator(value)

Returns `true` for any object that implements its own `.next()` and `.throw()` methods and has a function definition for `Symbol.iterator`.

##### .generatorFunction(value)

##### .asyncFunction(value)

Returns `true` for any `async` function that can be called with the `await` operator.

```js
is.asyncFunction(async () => {});
// => true

is.asyncFunction(() => {});
// => false
```

##### .boundFunction(value)

Returns `true` for any `bound` function.

```js
is.boundFunction(() => {});
// => true

is.boundFunction(function () {}.bind(null));
// => true

is.boundFunction(function () {});
// => false
```

##### .map(value)
##### .set(value)
##### .weakMap(value)
##### .weakSet(value)

#### Typed arrays

##### .int8Array(value)
##### .uint8Array(value)
##### .uint8ClampedArray(value)
##### .int16Array(value)
##### .uint16Array(value)
##### .int32Array(value)
##### .uint32Array(value)
##### .float32Array(value)
##### .float64Array(value)

#### Structured data

##### .arrayBuffer(value)
##### .sharedArrayBuffer(value)
##### .dataView(value)

#### Emptiness

##### .emptyString(value)

Returns `true` if the value is a `string` and the `.length` is 0.

##### .nonEmptyString(value)

Returns `true` if the value is a `string` and the `.length` is more than 0.

##### .emptyStringOrWhitespace(value)

Returns `true` if `is.emptyString(value)` or if it's a `string` that is all whitespace.

##### .emptyArray(value)

Returns `true` if the value is an `Array` and the `.length` is 0.

##### .nonEmptyArray(value)

Returns `true` if the value is an `Array` and the `.length` is more than 0.

##### .emptyObject(value)

Returns `true` if the value is an `Object` and `Object.keys(value).length` is 0.

Please note that `Object.keys` returns only own enumerable properties. Hence something like this can happen:

```js
const object1 = {};

Object.defineProperty(object1, 'property1', {
	value: 42,
	writable: true,
	enumerable: false,
	configurable: true
});

is.emptyObject(object1);
// => true
```

##### .nonEmptyObject(value)

is.any(is.string, {}, true, '🦄');
//=> true

is.any(is.boolean, 'unicorns', [], new Map());
//=> false
```

##### .all(predicate, ...values)

Returns `true` if **all** of the input `values` returns true in the `predicate`:

is.all(is.object, {}, new Map(), new Set());
//=> true

is.all(is.string, '🦄', [], 'unicorns');
//=> false
```


## FAQ

### Why yet another type checking module?

There are hundreds of type checking modules on npm, unfortunately, I couldn't find any that fit my needs:

- Includes both type methods and ability to get the type
- Types of primitives returned as lowercase and object types as camelcase
- Covers all built-ins
- Unsurprising behavior
- Well-maintained
- Comprehensive test suite

For the ones I found, pick 3 of these.

The most common mistakes I noticed in these modules was using `instanceof` for type checking, forgetting that functions are objects, and omitting `symbol` as a primitive.

```


## API

### ansiRegex(options?)

#### options

Type: `object`

##### onlyFirst

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false` *(Matches any ANSI escape codes in a string)*

Match only the first ANSI escape.


## FAQ

### Why do you test for codes not in the ECMA 48 standard?

Some of the codes we run as a test are codes that we acquired finding various lists of non-standard or manufacturer specific codes. We test for both standard and non-standard codes, as most of them follow the same or similar format and can be safely matched in strings without the risk of removing actual string content. There are a few non-standard control codes that do not follow the traditional format (i.e. they end in numbers) thus forcing us to exclude them from the test because we cannot reliably match them.

On the historical side, those ECMA standards were established in the early 90's whereas the VT100, for example, was designed in the mid/late 70's. At that point in time, control codes were still pretty ungoverned and engineers used them for a multitude of things, namely to activate hardware ports that may have been proprietary. Somewhere else you see a similar 'anarchy' of codes is in the x86 architecture for processors; there are a ton of "interrupts" that can mean different things on certain brands of processors, most of which have been phased out.

# ansi-styles [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chalk/ansi-styles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chalk/ansi-styles)

> [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors_and_Styles) for styling strings in the terminal

You probably want the higher-level [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) module for styling your strings.

<img src="screenshot.svg" width="900">

## Install

```
$ npm install ansi-styles
```

## Usage

```js
const style = require('ansi-styles');

console.log(`${style.green.open}Hello world!${style.green.close}`);


// Color conversion between 16/256/truecolor
// NOTE: If conversion goes to 16 colors or 256 colors, the original color
//       may be degraded to fit that color palette. This means terminals
//       that do not support 16 million colors will best-match the
//       original color.
console.log(style.bgColor.ansi.hsl(120, 80, 72) + 'Hello world!' + style.bgColor.close);
console.log(style.color.ansi256.rgb(199, 20, 250) + 'Hello world!' + style.color.close);
console.log(style.color.ansi16m.hex('#abcdef') + 'Hello world!' + style.color.close);
```

## API

Each style has an `open` and `close` property.

## Styles

### Modifiers

- `reset`
- `bold`
- `dim`
- `italic` *(Not widely supported)*
- `underline`
- `inverse`
- `hidden`
- `strikethrough` *(Not widely supported)*

### Colors

- `black`
- `red`
- `green`
- `yellow`
- `blue`
- `magenta`
- `cyan`
- `white`
- `blackBright` (alias: `gray`, `grey`)
- `redBright`
- `greenBright`
- `yellowBright`
- `blueBright`
- `magentaBright`
- `cyanBright`
- `whiteBright`

### Background colors

- `bgBlack`
- `bgRed`
- `bgGreen`
- `bgYellow`
- `bgBlue`
- `bgMagenta`
- `bgCyan`
- `bgWhite`
- `bgBlackBright` (alias: `bgGray`, `bgGrey`)
- `bgRedBright`
- `bgGreenBright`
- `bgYellowBright`
- `bgBlueBright`
- `bgMagentaBright`
- `bgCyanBright`
- `bgWhiteBright`

## Advanced usage

By default, you get a map of styles, but the styles are also available as groups. They are non-enumerable so they don't show up unless you access them explicitly. This makes it easier to expose only a subset in a higher-level module.

- `style.modifier`
- `style.color`
- `style.bgColor`

###### Example

```js
console.log(style.color.green.open);
```

Raw escape codes (i.e. without the CSI escape prefix `\u001B[` and render mode postfix `m`) are available under `style.codes`, which returns a `Map` with the open codes as keys and close codes as values.

###### Example

```js
console.log(style.codes.get(36));
//=> 39
```

## [256 / 16 million (TrueColor) support](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728)

`ansi-styles` uses the [`color-convert`](https://github.com/Qix-/color-convert) package to allow for converting between various colors and ANSI escapes, with support for 256 and 16 million colors.

The following color spaces from `color-convert` are supported:

- `rgb`
- `hex`
- `keyword`
- `hsl`
- `hsv`
- `hwb`
- `ansi`
- `ansi256`

To use these, call the associated conversion function with the intended output, for example:

```js
style.color.ansi.rgb(100, 200, 15); // RGB to 16 color ansi foreground code
style.bgColor.ansi.rgb(100, 200, 15); // RGB to 16 color ansi background code

style.color.ansi256.hsl(120, 100, 60); // HSL to 256 color ansi foreground code
style.bgColor.ansi256.hsl(120, 100, 60); // HSL to 256 color ansi foreground code

style.color.ansi16m.hex('#C0FFEE'); // Hex (RGB) to 16 million color foreground code
style.bgColor.ansi16m.hex('#C0FFEE'); // Hex (RGB) to 16 million color background code
```

![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/at-least-node)
![node](https://img.shields.io/node/v/at-least-node)
![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/at-least-node)

Sometimes you need to check if you're on _at least_ a given Node.js version, but you don't want to pull in the whole [`semver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver) kitchen sink. That's what `at-least-node` is for.

| Package         | Size    |
| --------------- | ------- |
| `at-least-node` | 2.6 kB  |
| `semver`        | 75.5 kB |

```js
const atLeastNode = require('at-least-node')
atLeastNode('10.12.0')
// -> true on Node 10.12.0+, false on anything below that
```

When passing in a version string:

- You cannot include a leading `v` (i.e. `v10.12.0`)
- You cannot omit sections (i.e. `10.12`)
- You cannot use pre-releases (i.e. `1.0.0-beta`)
- There is no input validation, if you make a mistake, the resulting behavior is undefined

{ start: 3, end: 14, pre: 'pre', body: 'in{nested}', post: 'post' }
{ start: 3,
  end: 9,
  pre: 'pre',
  body: 'first',
  post: 'between{second}post' }
{ start: 3, end: 17, pre: 'pre', body: 'in{nest}', post: 'post' }
```

## API

### var m = balanced(a, b, str)

For the first non-nested matching pair of `a` and `b` in `str`, return an
object with those keys:

* **start** the index of the first match of `a`
* **end** the index of the matching `b`
* **pre** the preamble, `a` and `b` not included
* **body** the match, `a` and `b` not included
* **post** the postscript, `a` and `b` not included

If there's no match, `undefined` will be returned.

If the `str` contains more `a` than `b` / there are unmatched pairs, the first match that was closed will be used. For example, `{{a}` will match `['{', 'a', '']` and `{a}}` will match `['', 'a', '}']`.

### var r = balanced.range(a, b, str)

For the first non-nested matching pair of `a` and `b` in `str`, return an
array with indexes: `[ <a index>, <b index> ]`.

If there's no match, `undefined` will be returned.

If the `str` contains more `a` than `b` / there are unmatched pairs, the first match that was closed will be used. For example, `{{a}` will match `[ 1, 3 ]` and `{a}}` will match `[0, 2]`.

## Installation

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```bash
npm install balanced-match
```

# brace-expansion

[Brace expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Brace-Expansion.html), 
as known from sh/bash, in JavaScript.

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/juliangruber/brace-expansion.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/juliangruber/brace-expansion)
[![downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/brace-expansion.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/brace-expansion)
[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/juliangruber/brace-expansion.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

[![testling badge](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion.png)](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion)

## Example

```js
var expand = require('brace-expansion');

expand('file-{a,b,c}.jpg')
// => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-b.jpg', 'file-c.jpg']

expand('-v{,,}')
// => ['-v', '-v', '-v']

expand('file{0..2}.jpg')
// => ['file0.jpg', 'file1.jpg', 'file2.jpg']

expand('file-{a..c}.jpg')
// => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-b.jpg', 'file-c.jpg']

expand('file{2..0}.jpg')
// => ['file2.jpg', 'file1.jpg', 'file0.jpg']

expand('file{0..4..2}.jpg')
// => ['file0.jpg', 'file2.jpg', 'file4.jpg']

expand('file-{a..e..2}.jpg')
// => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-c.jpg', 'file-e.jpg']

expand('file{00..10..5}.jpg')
// => ['file00.jpg', 'file05.jpg', 'file10.jpg']

expand('{{A..C},{a..c}}')
// => ['A', 'B', 'C', 'a', 'b', 'c']

expand('ppp{,config,oe{,conf}}')
// => ['ppp', 'pppconfig', 'pppoe', 'pppoeconf']
```

## API

```js
var expand = require('brace-expansion');
```

### var expanded = expand(str)

Return an array of all possible and valid expansions of `str`. If none are
found, `[str]` is returned.

Valid expansions are:

```js
/^(.*,)+(.+)?$/
// {a,b,...}
```

A comma separated list of options, like `{a,b}` or `{a,{b,c}}` or `{,a,}`.

```js
/^-?\d+\.\.-?\d+(\.\.-?\d+)?$/
// {x..y[..incr]}
```

A numeric sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment.
If `x` or `y` start with a leading `0`, all the numbers will be padded
to have equal length. Negative numbers and backwards iteration work too.

```js
/^-?\d+\.\.-?\d+(\.\.-?\d+)?$/
// {x..y[..incr]}
```

An alphabetic sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment.
`x` and `y` must be exactly one character, and if given, `incr` must be a
number.

For compatibility reasons, the string `${` is not eligible for brace expansion.

## Installation

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```bash
npm install brace-expansion

> Bash-like brace expansion, implemented in JavaScript. Safer than other brace expansion libs, with complete support for the Bash 4.3 braces specification, without sacrificing speed.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save braces
```

## v3.0.0 Released!!

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## Why use braces?

Brace patterns make globs more powerful by adding the ability to match specific ranges and sequences of characters.

* **Accurate** - complete support for the [Bash 4.3 Brace Expansion](www.gnu.org/software/bash/) specification (passes all of the Bash braces tests)
* **[fast and performant](#benchmarks)** - Starts fast, runs fast and [scales well](#performance) as patterns increase in complexity.
* **Organized code base** - The parser and compiler are easy to maintain and update when edge cases crop up.
* **Well-tested** - Thousands of test assertions, and passes all of the Bash, minimatch, and [brace-expansion](https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion) unit tests (as of the date this was written).
* **Safer** - You shouldn't have to worry about users defining aggressive or malicious brace patterns that can break your application. Braces takes measures to prevent malicious regex that can be used for DDoS attacks (see [catastrophic backtracking](https://www.regular-expressions.info/catastrophic.html)).
* [Supports lists](#lists) - (aka "sets") `a/{b,c}/d` => `['a/b/d', 'a/c/d']`
* [Supports sequences](#sequences) - (aka "ranges") `{01..03}` => `['01', '02', '03']`
* [Supports steps](#steps) - (aka "increments") `{2..10..2}` => `['2', '4', '6', '8', '10']`
* [Supports escaping](#escaping) - To prevent evaluation of special characters.

## Usage

The main export is a function that takes one or more brace `patterns` and `options`.

```js
const braces = require('braces');
// braces(patterns[, options]);

console.log(braces(['{01..05}', '{a..e}']));
//=> ['(0[1-5])', '([a-e])']

console.log(braces(['{01..05}', '{a..e}'], { expand: true }));
//=> ['01', '02', '03', '04', '05', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```

### Brace Expansion vs. Compilation

By default, brace patterns are compiled into strings that are optimized for creating regular expressions and matching.

**Compiled**

```js
console.log(braces('a/{x,y,z}/b')); 
//=> ['a/(x|y|z)/b']
console.log(braces(['a/{01..20}/b', 'a/{1..5}/b'])); 
//=> [ 'a/(0[1-9]|1[0-9]|20)/b', 'a/([1-5])/b' ]
```

**Expanded**

Enable brace expansion by setting the `expand` option to true, or by using [braces.expand()](#expand) (returns an array similar to what you'd expect from Bash, or `echo {1..5}`, or [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)):

```js
console.log(braces('a/{x,y,z}/b', { expand: true }));
//=> ['a/x/b', 'a/y/b', 'a/z/b']

console.log(braces.expand('{01..10}'));
//=> ['01','02','03','04','05','06','07','08','09','10']
```

### Lists

Expand lists (like Bash "sets"):

```js
console.log(braces('a/{foo,bar,baz}/*.js'));
//=> ['a/(foo|bar|baz)/*.js']

console.log(braces.expand('a/{foo,bar,baz}/*.js'));
//=> ['a/foo/*.js', 'a/bar/*.js', 'a/baz/*.js']
```

### Sequences

Expand ranges of characters (like Bash "sequences"):

```js
console.log(braces.expand('{1..3}'));                // ['1', '2', '3']
console.log(braces.expand('a/{1..3}/b'));            // ['a/1/b', 'a/2/b', 'a/3/b']
console.log(braces('{a..c}', { expand: true }));     // ['a', 'b', 'c']
console.log(braces('foo/{a..c}', { expand: true })); // ['foo/a', 'foo/b', 'foo/c']

// supports zero-padded ranges
console.log(braces('a/{01..03}/b'));   //=> ['a/(0[1-3])/b']
console.log(braces('a/{001..300}/b')); //=> ['a/(0{2}[1-9]|0[1-9][0-9]|[12][0-9]{2}|300)/b']
```

See [fill-range](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/fill-range) for all available range-expansion options.

### Steppped ranges

Steps, or increments, may be used with ranges:

```js
console.log(braces.expand('{2..10..2}'));
//=> ['2', '4', '6', '8', '10']

console.log(braces('{2..10..2}'));
//=> ['(2|4|6|8|10)']
```

When the [.optimize](#optimize) method is used, or [options.optimize](#optionsoptimize) is set to true, sequences are passed to [to-regex-range](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/to-regex-range) for expansion.

### Nesting

Brace patterns may be nested. The results of each expanded string are not sorted, and left to right order is preserved.

**"Expanded" braces**

```js
console.log(braces.expand('a{b,c,/{x,y}}/e'));
//=> ['ab/e', 'ac/e', 'a/x/e', 'a/y/e']

console.log(braces.expand('a/{x,{1..5},y}/c'));
//=> ['a/x/c', 'a/1/c', 'a/2/c', 'a/3/c', 'a/4/c', 'a/5/c', 'a/y/c']
```

**"Optimized" braces**

```js
console.log(braces('a{b,c,/{x,y}}/e'));
//=> ['a(b|c|/(x|y))/e']

console.log(braces('a/{x,{1..5},y}/c'));
//=> ['a/(x|([1-5])|y)/c']
```

### Escaping

**Escaping braces**

A brace pattern will not be expanded or evaluted if _either the opening or closing brace is escaped_:

```js
console.log(braces.expand('a\\{d,c,b}e'));
//=> ['a{d,c,b}e']

console.log(braces.expand('a{d,c,b\\}e'));
//=> ['a{d,c,b}e']
```

**Escaping commas**

Commas inside braces may also be escaped:

```js
console.log(braces.expand('a{b\\,c}d'));
//=> ['a{b,c}d']

console.log(braces.expand('a{d\\,c,b}e'));
//=> ['ad,ce', 'abe']
```

**Single items**

Following bash conventions, a brace pattern is also not expanded when it contains a single character:

```js
console.log(braces.expand('a{b}c'));
//=> ['a{b}c']
```

## Options

### options.maxLength

**Type**: `Number`

**Default**: `65,536`

**Description**: Limit the length of the input string. Useful when the input string is generated or your application allows users to pass a string, et cetera.

```js
console.log(braces('a/{b,c}/d', { maxLength: 3 }));  //=> throws an error
```

### options.expand

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: Generate an "expanded" brace pattern (alternatively you can use the `braces.expand()` method, which does the same thing).

```js
console.log(braces('a/{b,c}/d', { expand: true }));
//=> [ 'a/b/d', 'a/c/d' ]
```

### options.nodupes

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: Remove duplicates from the returned array.

### options.rangeLimit

**Type**: `Number`

**Default**: `1000`

**Description**: To prevent malicious patterns from being passed by users, an error is thrown when `braces.expand()` is used or `options.expand` is true and the generated range will exceed the `rangeLimit`.

You can customize `options.rangeLimit` or set it to `Inifinity` to disable this altogether.

**Examples**

```js
// pattern exceeds the "rangeLimit", so it's optimized automatically
console.log(braces.expand('{1..1000}'));
//=> ['([1-9]|[1-9][0-9]{1,2}|1000)']

// pattern does not exceed "rangeLimit", so it's NOT optimized
console.log(braces.expand('{1..100}'));
//=> ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', '24', '25', '26', '27', '28', '29', '30', '31', '32', '33', '34', '35', '36', '37', '38', '39', '40', '41', '42', '43', '44', '45', '46', '47', '48', '49', '50', '51', '52', '53', '54', '55', '56', '57', '58', '59', '60', '61', '62', '63', '64', '65', '66', '67', '68', '69', '70', '71', '72', '73', '74', '75', '76', '77', '78', '79', '80', '81', '82', '83', '84', '85', '86', '87', '88', '89', '90', '91', '92', '93', '94', '95', '96', '97', '98', '99', '100']
```

### options.transform

**Type**: `Function`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: Customize range expansion.

**Example: Transforming non-numeric values**

```js
const alpha = braces.expand('x/{a..e}/y', {
  transform(value, index) {
    // When non-numeric values are passed, "value" is a character code.
    return 'foo/' + String.fromCharCode(value) + '-' + index;
  }
});
console.log(alpha);
//=> [ 'x/foo/a-0/y', 'x/foo/b-1/y', 'x/foo/c-2/y', 'x/foo/d-3/y', 'x/foo/e-4/y' ]
```

**Example: Transforming numeric values**

```js
const numeric = braces.expand('{1..5}', {
  transform(value) {
    // when numeric values are passed, "value" is a number
    return 'foo/' + value * 2;
  }
});
console.log(numeric); 
//=> [ 'foo/2', 'foo/4', 'foo/6', 'foo/8', 'foo/10' ]
```

### options.quantifiers

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: In regular expressions, quanitifiers can be used to specify how many times a token can be repeated. For example, `a{1,3}` will match the letter `a` one to three times.

Unfortunately, regex quantifiers happen to share the same syntax as [Bash lists](#lists)

The `quantifiers` option tells braces to detect when [regex quantifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp#quantifiers) are defined in the given pattern, and not to try to expand them as lists.

**Examples**

```js
const braces = require('braces');
console.log(braces('a/b{1,3}/{x,y,z}'));
//=> [ 'a/b(1|3)/(x|y|z)' ]
console.log(braces('a/b{1,3}/{x,y,z}', {quantifiers: true}));
//=> [ 'a/b{1,3}/(x|y|z)' ]
console.log(braces('a/b{1,3}/{x,y,z}', {quantifiers: true, expand: true}));
//=> [ 'a/b{1,3}/x', 'a/b{1,3}/y', 'a/b{1,3}/z' ]
```

### options.unescape

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: Strip backslashes that were used for escaping from the result.

## What is "brace expansion"?

Brace expansion is a type of parameter expansion that was made popular by unix shells for generating lists of strings, as well as regex-like matching when used alongside wildcards (globs).

In addition to "expansion", braces are also used for matching. In other words:

* [brace expansion](#brace-expansion) is for generating new lists
* [brace matching](#brace-matching) is for filtering existing lists

<details>
<summary><strong>More about brace expansion</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

There are two main types of brace expansion:

1. **lists**: which are defined using comma-separated values inside curly braces: `{a,b,c}`
2. **sequences**: which are defined using a starting value and an ending value, separated by two dots: `a{1..3}b`. Optionally, a third argument may be passed to define a "step" or increment to use: `a{1..100..10}b`. These are also sometimes referred to as "ranges".

Here are some example brace patterns to illustrate how they work:

**Sets**

```
{a,b,c}       => a b c
{a,b,c}{1,2}  => a1 a2 b1 b2 c1 c2
```

**Sequences**

```
{1..9}        => 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
{4..-4}       => 4 3 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3 -4
{1..20..3}    => 1 4 7 10 13 16 19
{a..j}        => a b c d e f g h i j
{j..a}        => j i h g f e d c b a
{a..z..3}     => a d g j m p s v y
```

**Combination**

Sets and sequences can be mixed together or used along with any other strings.

```
{a,b,c}{1..3}   => a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3 c1 c2 c3
foo/{a,b,c}/bar => foo/a/bar foo/b/bar foo/c/bar
```

The fact that braces can be "expanded" from relatively simple patterns makes them ideal for quickly generating test fixtures, file paths, and similar use cases.

## Brace matching

In addition to _expansion_, brace patterns are also useful for performing regular-expression-like matching.

For example, the pattern `foo/{1..3}/bar` would match any of following strings:

```
foo/1/bar
foo/2/bar
foo/3/bar
```

But not:

```
baz/1/qux
baz/2/qux
baz/3/qux
```

Braces can also be combined with [glob patterns](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/micromatch) to perform more advanced wildcard matching. For example, the pattern `*/{1..3}/*` would match any of following strings:

```
foo/1/bar
foo/2/bar
foo/3/bar
baz/1/qux
baz/2/qux
baz/3/qux
```

## Brace matching pitfalls

Although brace patterns offer a user-friendly way of matching ranges or sets of strings, there are also some major disadvantages and potential risks you should be aware of.

### tldr

**"brace bombs"**

* brace expansion can eat up a huge amount of processing resources
* as brace patterns increase _linearly in size_, the system resources required to expand the pattern increase exponentially
* users can accidentally (or intentially) exhaust your system's resources resulting in the equivalent of a DoS attack (bonus: no programming knowledge is required!)

For a more detailed explanation with examples, see the [geometric complexity](#geometric-complexity) section.

### The solution

Jump to the [performance section](#performance) to see how Braces solves this problem in comparison to other libraries.

### Geometric complexity

At minimum, brace patterns with sets limited to two elements have quadradic or `O(n^2)` complexity. But the complexity of the algorithm increases exponentially as the number of sets, _and elements per set_, increases, which is `O(n^c)`.

For example, the following sets demonstrate quadratic (`O(n^2)`) complexity:

```
{1,2}{3,4}      => (2X2)    => 13 14 23 24
{1,2}{3,4}{5,6} => (2X2X2)  => 135 136 145 146 235 236 245 246
```

But add an element to a set, and we get a n-fold Cartesian product with `O(n^c)` complexity:

```
{1,2,3}{4,5,6}{7,8,9} => (3X3X3) => 147 148 149 157 158 159 167 168 169 247 248 
                                    249 257 258 259 267 268 269 347 348 349 357 
                                    358 359 367 368 369
```

Now, imagine how this complexity grows given that each element is a n-tuple:

```
{1..100}{1..100}         => (100X100)     => 10,000 elements (38.4 kB)
{1..100}{1..100}{1..100} => (100X100X100) => 1,000,000 elements (5.76 MB)
```

Although these examples are clearly contrived, they demonstrate how brace patterns can quickly grow out of control.

## Performance

Braces is not only screaming fast, it's also more accurate the other brace expansion libraries.

### Better algorithms

Fortunately there is a solution to the ["brace bomb" problem](#brace-matching-pitfalls): _don't expand brace patterns into an array when they're used for matching_.

Instead, convert the pattern into an optimized regular expression. This is easier said than done, and braces is the only library that does this currently.

**The proof is in the numbers**

Minimatch gets exponentially slower as patterns increase in complexity, braces does not. The following results were generated using `braces()` and `minimatch.braceExpand()`, respectively.

| **Pattern**                 | **braces**         | **[minimatch][]**            |

| `{1..10}`                   | `10 B` (533μs)     | `20 B` (37μs)                |
| `{1..3}`                    | `7 B` (190μs)      | `5 B` (27μs)                 |

### Faster algorithms

When you need expansion, braces is still much faster.

_(the following results were generated using `braces.expand()` and `minimatch.braceExpand()`, respectively)_

| **Pattern**     | **braces**                  | **[minimatch][]**            |
| ---             | ---                         | ---                          |
| `{1..10000000}` | `78.89 MB` (2s 698ms 642μs) | `78.89 MB` (18s 601ms 974μs) |
| `{1..1000000}`  | `6.89 MB` (458ms 576μs)     | `6.89 MB` (1s 491ms 621μs)   |
| `{1..100000}`   | `588.89 kB` (20ms 728μs)    | `588.89 kB` (156ms 919μs)    |
| `{1..10000}`    | `48.89 kB` (2ms 202μs)      | `48.89 kB` (13ms 641μs)      |
| `{1..1000}`     | `3.89 kB` (1ms 796μs)       | `3.89 kB` (1ms 958μs)        |
| `{1..100}`      | `291 B` (424μs)             | `291 B` (211μs)              |
| `{1..10}`       | `20 B` (487μs)              | `20 B` (72μs)                |
| `{1..3}`        | `5 B` (166μs)               | `5 B` (27μs)                 |

## API

The methods returns a promise that resolves when the `end` event fires on the stream, indicating that there is no more data to be read. The stream is switched to flowing mode.

### getStream(stream, options?)

Get the `stream` as a string.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### encoding

Type: `string`\
Default: `'utf8'`

[Encoding](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer) of the incoming stream.

##### maxBuffer

Type: `number`\
Default: `Infinity`

Maximum length of the returned string. If it exceeds this value before the stream ends, the promise will be rejected with a `getStream.MaxBufferError` error.

### getStream.buffer(stream, options?)

Get the `stream` as a buffer.

It honors the `maxBuffer` option as above, but it refers to byte length rather than string length.

### getStream.array(stream, options?)

Get the `stream` as an array of values.

It honors both the `maxBuffer` and `encoding` options. The behavior changes slightly based on the encoding chosen:

- When `encoding` is unset, it assumes an [object mode stream](https://nodesource.com/blog/understanding-object-streams/) and collects values emitted from `stream` unmodified. In this case `maxBuffer` refers to the number of items in the array (not the sum of their sizes).

- When `encoding` is set to `buffer`, it collects an array of buffers. `maxBuffer` refers to the summed byte lengths of every buffer in the array.

- When `encoding` is set to anything else, it collects an array of strings. `maxBuffer` refers to the summed character lengths of every string in the array.

## Errors

If the input stream emits an `error` event, the promise will be rejected with the error. The buffered data will be attached to the `bufferedData` property of the error.

```js
(async () => {
	try {
		await getStream(streamThatErrorsAtTheEnd('unicorn'));
	} catch (error) {
		console.log(error.bufferedData);
		//=> 'unicorn'
	}
})()
```

## FAQ

### How is this different from [`concat-stream`](https://github.com/maxogden/concat-stream)?

This module accepts a stream instead of being one and returns a promise instead of using a callback. The API is simpler and it only supports returning a string, buffer, or array. It doesn't have a fragile type inference. You explicitly choose what you want. And it doesn't depend on the huge `readable-stream` package.

# cacheable-request

> Wrap native HTTP requests with RFC compliant cache support

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/cacheable-request.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/cacheable-request)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/cacheable-request/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/cacheable-request?branch=master)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/cacheable-request.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cacheable-request)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cacheable-request.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cacheable-request)

[RFC 7234](http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html) compliant HTTP caching for native Node.js HTTP/HTTPS requests. Caching works out of the box in memory or is easily pluggable with a wide range of storage adapters.

**Note:** This is a low level wrapper around the core HTTP modules, it's not a high level request library.

## Features

- Only stores cacheable responses as defined by RFC 7234
- Fresh cache entries are served directly from cache
- Stale cache entries are revalidated with `If-None-Match`/`If-Modified-Since` headers
- 304 responses from revalidation requests use cached body
- Updates `Age` header on cached responses
- Can completely bypass cache on a per request basis
- In memory cache by default
- Official support for Redis, MongoDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL storage adapters
- Easily plug in your own or third-party storage adapters
- If DB connection fails, cache is automatically bypassed ([disabled by default](#optsautomaticfailover))
- Adds cache support to any existing HTTP code with minimal changes
- Uses [http-cache-semantics](https://github.com/pornel/http-cache-semantics) internally for HTTP RFC 7234 compliance

## Install

```shell
npm install cacheable-request
```

## Usage

```js
const http = require('http');
const CacheableRequest = require('cacheable-request');

// Then instead of
const req = http.request('http://example.com', cb);
req.end();

// You can do
const cacheableRequest = new CacheableRequest(http.request);
const cacheReq = cacheableRequest('http://example.com', cb);
cacheReq.on('request', req => req.end());
// Future requests to 'example.com' will be returned from cache if still valid

// You pass in any other http.request API compatible method to be wrapped with cache support:
const cacheableRequest = new CacheableRequest(https.request);
const cacheableRequest = new CacheableRequest(electron.net);
```

## Storage Adapters

`cacheable-request` uses [Keyv](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv) to support a wide range of storage adapters.

For example, to use Redis as a cache backend, you just need to install the official Redis Keyv storage adapter:

```
npm install @keyv/redis
```

And then you can pass `CacheableRequest` your connection string:

```js
const cacheableRequest = new CacheableRequest(http.request, 'redis://user:pass@localhost:6379');
```

[View all official Keyv storage adapters.](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv#official-storage-adapters)

Keyv also supports anything that follows the Map API so it's easy to write your own storage adapter or use a third-party solution.

e.g The following are all valid storage adapters

```js
const storageAdapter = new Map();
// or
const storageAdapter = require('./my-storage-adapter');
// or
const QuickLRU = require('quick-lru');
const storageAdapter = new QuickLRU({ maxSize: 1000 });

const cacheableRequest = new CacheableRequest(http.request, storageAdapter);
```

View the [Keyv docs](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv) for more information on how to use storage adapters.

## API

### new cacheableRequest(request, [storageAdapter])

Returns the provided request function wrapped with cache support.

#### request

Type: `function`

Request function to wrap with cache support. Should be [`http.request`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_request_options_callback) or a similar API compatible request function.

#### storageAdapter

Type: `Keyv storage adapter`<br>
Default: `new Map()`

A [Keyv](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv) storage adapter instance, or connection string if using with an official Keyv storage adapter.

### Instance

#### cacheableRequest(opts, [cb])

Returns an event emitter.

##### opts

Type: `object`, `string`

- Any of the default request functions options.
- Any [`http-cache-semantics`](https://github.com/kornelski/http-cache-semantics#constructor-options) options.
- Any of the following:

###### opts.cache

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

If the cache should be used. Setting this to false will completely bypass the cache for the current request.

###### opts.strictTtl

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

If set to `true` once a cached resource has expired it is deleted and will have to be re-requested.

If set to `false` (default), after a cached resource's TTL expires it is kept in the cache and will be revalidated on the next request with `If-None-Match`/`If-Modified-Since` headers.

###### opts.maxTtl

Type: `number`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Limits TTL. The `number` represents milliseconds.

###### opts.automaticFailover

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

When set to `true`, if the DB connection fails we will automatically fallback to a network request. DB errors will still be emitted to notify you of the problem even though the request callback may succeed.

###### opts.forceRefresh

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Forces refreshing the cache. If the response could be retrieved from the cache, it will perform a new request and override the cache instead.

##### cb

Type: `function`

The callback function which will receive the response as an argument.

The response can be either a [Node.js HTTP response stream](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) or a [responselike object](https://github.com/lukechilds/responselike). The response will also have a `fromCache` property set with a boolean value.

##### .on('request', request)

`request` event to get the request object of the request.

**Note:** This event will only fire if an HTTP request is actually made, not when a response is retrieved from cache. However, you should always handle the `request` event to end the request and handle any potential request errors.

##### .on('response', response)

`response` event to get the response object from the HTTP request or cache.

##### .on('error', error)

`error` event emitted in case of an error with the cache.

Errors emitted here will be an instance of `CacheableRequest.RequestError` or `CacheableRequest.CacheError`. You will only ever receive a `RequestError` if the request function throws (normally caused by invalid user input). Normal request errors should be handled inside the `request` event.

To properly handle all error scenarios you should use the following pattern:

```js
cacheableRequest('example.com', cb)
  .on('error', err => {
    if (err instanceof CacheableRequest.CacheError) {
      handleCacheError(err); // Cache error
    } else if (err instanceof CacheableRequest.RequestError) {
      handleRequestError(err); // Request function thrown
    }
  })
  .on('request', req => {
    req.on('error', handleRequestError); // Request error emitted
    req.end();
  });
```

**Note:** Database connection errors are emitted here, however `cacheable-request` will attempt to re-request the resource and bypass the cache on a connection error. Therefore a database connection error doesn't necessarily mean the request won't be fulfilled.

### [Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/check-links/readme.md](Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/check-links/readme.md)
# check-links

> Robustly checks an array of URLs for liveness.

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/check-links.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/check-links) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/transitive-bullshit/check-links.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/transitive-bullshit/check-links) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

For each URL, it first attempts an HTTP HEAD request, and if that fails it will attempt
an HTTP GET request, retrying several times by default with exponential falloff.

This module handles concurrency and retry logic so you can check the status of thousands
of links quickly and robustly.

## Install

This module requires `node >= 8`.

```bash
npm install --save check-links
```

## Usage

```js
const checkLinks = require('check-links')

const results = await checkLinks([
  'https://foo.com',
  'https://404.com',
])

results['https://foo.com'] // { status: 'alive', statusCode: 200 }
results['https://404.com'] // { status: 'dead', statusCode: 404 }

// example using a custom timeout and retry count
const results2 = await checkLinks([
  'https://foo.com',
  'https://404.com',
], {
  timeout: 30000,
  retry: 1
})
```

-   Supports HTTP and HTTPS urls.
-   Defaults to a 30 second timeout per HTTP request with 2 retries.
-   Defaults to a Mac OS Chrome `user-agent`.
-   Defaults to following redirects.

## API

<!-- Generated by documentation.js. Update this documentation by updating the source code. -->

### [checkLinks](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/check-links/blob/cf5fbcf0fc0bd150097034887b7c132384794549/index.js#L34-L51)

Robustly checks an array of URLs for liveness.

For each URL, it first attempts an HTTP HEAD request, and if that fails it will attempt
an HTTP GET request, retrying several times by default with exponential falloff.

Returns a `Map<String, LivenessResult>` that maps each input URL to an object
containing `status` and possibly `statusCode`.

`LivenessResult.status` will be one of the following:

-   `alive` if the URL is reachable (2XX status code)
-   `dead` if the URL is not reachable
-   `invalid` if the URL was parsed as invalid or used an unsupported protocol

`LivenessResult.statusCode` will contain an integer HTTP status code if that URL resolved
properly.

Type: `function (urls, opts)`

-   `urls` **[array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)>** Array of urls to test
-   `opts` **[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)?** Optional configuration options (any extra options are passed to [got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got#options))
    -   `opts.concurrency` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** Maximum number of urls to resolve concurrently (optional, default `8`)

# cliui

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yargs/cliui.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/yargs/cliui)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/yargs/cliui/badge.svg?branch=)](https://coveralls.io/r/yargs/cliui?branch=)

[![Standard Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-standard%20version-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version)

easily create complex multi-column command-line-interfaces.

## Example

```js
var ui = require('cliui')()

ui.div('Usage: $0 [command] [options]')

ui.div({
  text: 'Options:',
  padding: [2, 0, 2, 0]
})

ui.div(
  {
    text: "-f, --file",
    width: 20,
    padding: [0, 4, 0, 4]
  },
  {
    text: "the file to load." +
      chalk.green("(if this description is long it wraps).")
    ,
    width: 20
  },
  {
    text: chalk.red("[required]"),
    align: 'right'
  }
)

console.log(ui.toString())
```

<img width="500" src="screenshot.png">

## Layout DSL

cliui exposes a simple layout DSL:

If you create a single `ui.div`, passing a string rather than an
object:

* `\n`: characters will be interpreted as new rows.
* `\t`: characters will be interpreted as new columns.
* `\s`: characters will be interpreted as padding.

**as an example...**

```js
var ui = require('./')({
  width: 60
})

ui.div(
  'Usage: node ./bin/foo.js\n' +
  '  <regex>\t  provide a regex\n' +
  '  <glob>\t  provide a glob\t [required]'
)

console.log(ui.toString())
```

**will output:**

```shell
Usage: node ./bin/foo.js
  <regex>  provide a regex
  <glob>   provide a glob          [required]
```

## Methods

```js
cliui = require('cliui')
```

### cliui({width: integer})

Specify the maximum width of the UI being generated.
If no width is provided, cliui will try to get the current window's width and use it, and if that doesn't work, width will be set to `80`.

### cliui({wrap: boolean})

Enable or disable the wrapping of text in a column.

### cliui.div(column, column, column)

Create a row with any number of columns, a column
can either be a string, or an object with the following
options:

* **text:** some text to place in the column.
* **width:** the width of a column.
* **align:** alignment, `right` or `center`.
* **padding:** `[top, right, bottom, left]`.
* **border:** should a border be placed around the div?

### cliui.span(column, column, column)

Similar to `div`, except the next row will be appended without
a new line being created.

### cliui.resetOutput()

Resets the UI elements of the current cliui instance, maintaining the values
set for `width` and `wrap`.

# clone-response

> Clone a Node.js HTTP response stream

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/clone-response.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/clone-response)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/clone-response/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/clone-response?branch=master)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/clone-response.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clone-response)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/clone-response.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clone-response)

Returns a new stream and copies over all properties and methods from the original response giving you a complete duplicate.

This is useful in situations where you need to consume the response stream but also want to pass an unconsumed stream somewhere else to be consumed later.

## Install

```shell
npm install --save clone-response
```

## Usage

```js
const http = require('http');
const cloneResponse = require('clone-response');

http.get('http://example.com', response => {
  const clonedResponse = cloneResponse(response);
  response.pipe(process.stdout);

  setImmediate(() => {
    // The response stream has already been consumed by the time this executes,
    // however the cloned response stream is still available.
    doSomethingWithResponse(clonedResponse);
  });
});
```

Please bear in mind that the process of cloning a stream consumes it. However, you can consume a stream multiple times in the same tick, therefore allowing you to create multiple clones. e.g:

```js
const clone1 = cloneResponse(response);
const clone2 = cloneResponse(response);
// response can still be consumed in this tick but cannot be consumed if passed
// into any async callbacks. clone1 and clone2 can be passed around and be
// consumed in the future.
```

## API

### cloneResponse(response)

Returns a clone of the passed in response.

#### response

Type: `stream`

A [Node.js HTTP response stream](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) to clone.

### [Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/color-convert/README.md](Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/color-convert/README.md)

# color-convert

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Qix-/color-convert.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Qix-/color-convert)

Color-convert is a color conversion library for JavaScript and node.
It converts all ways between `rgb`, `hsl`, `hsv`, `hwb`, `cmyk`, `ansi`, `ansi16`, `hex` strings, and CSS `keyword`s (will round to closest):

```js
var convert = require('color-convert');

convert.rgb.hsl(140, 200, 100);             // [96, 48, 59]
convert.keyword.rgb('blue');                // [0, 0, 255]

var rgbChannels = convert.rgb.channels;     // 3
var cmykChannels = convert.cmyk.channels;   // 4
var ansiChannels = convert.ansi16.channels; // 1
```

# Install

```console
$ npm install color-convert
```

# API

Simply get the property of the _from_ and _to_ conversion that you're looking for.

All functions have a rounded and unrounded variant. By default, return values are rounded. To get the unrounded (raw) results, simply tack on `.raw` to the function.

All 'from' functions have a hidden property called `.channels` that indicates the number of channels the function expects (not including alpha).

```js
var convert = require('color-convert');

// Hex to LAB
convert.hex.lab('DEADBF');         // [ 76, 21, -2 ]
convert.hex.lab.raw('DEADBF');     // [ 75.56213190997677, 20.653827952644754, -2.290532499330533 ]

// RGB to CMYK
convert.rgb.cmyk(167, 255, 4);     // [ 35, 0, 98, 0 ]
convert.rgb.cmyk.raw(167, 255, 4); // [ 34.509803921568626, 0, 98.43137254901961, 0 ]
```

### Arrays
All functions that accept multiple arguments also support passing an array.

Note that this does **not** apply to functions that convert from a color that only requires one value (e.g. `keyword`, `ansi256`, `hex`, etc.)

```js
var convert = require('color-convert');

convert.rgb.hex(123, 45, 67);      // '7B2D43'
convert.rgb.hex([123, 45, 67]);    // '7B2D43'
```

## Routing

Conversions that don't have an _explicitly_ defined conversion (in [conversions.js](conversions.js)), but can be converted by means of sub-conversions (e.g. XYZ -> **RGB** -> CMYK), are automatically routed together. This allows just about any color model supported by `color-convert` to be converted to any other model, so long as a sub-conversion path exists. This is also true for conversions requiring more than one step in between (e.g. LCH -> **LAB** -> **XYZ** -> **RGB** -> Hex).

Keep in mind that extensive conversions _may_ result in a loss of precision, and exist only to be complete. For a list of "direct" (single-step) conversions, see [conversions.js](conversions.js).

## Usage

By popular demand, `colors` now ships with two types of usages!

The super nifty way

```js
var colors = require('colors');

console.log('hello'.green); // outputs green text
console.log('i like cake and pies'.underline.red) // outputs red underlined text
console.log('inverse the color'.inverse); // inverses the color
console.log('OMG Rainbows!'.rainbow); // rainbow
console.log('Run the trap'.trap); // Drops the bass

```

or a slightly less nifty way which doesn't extend `String.prototype`

```js
var colors = require('colors/safe');

console.log(colors.green('hello')); // outputs green text
console.log(colors.red.underline('i like cake and pies')) // outputs red underlined text
console.log(colors.inverse('inverse the color')); // inverses the color
console.log(colors.rainbow('OMG Rainbows!')); // rainbow
console.log(colors.trap('Run the trap')); // Drops the bass

```

I prefer the first way. Some people seem to be afraid of extending `String.prototype` and prefer the second way. 

If you are writing good code you will never have an issue with the first approach. If you really don't want to touch `String.prototype`, the second usage will not touch `String` native object.

## Enabling/Disabling Colors

The package will auto-detect whether your terminal can use colors and enable/disable accordingly. When colors are disabled, the color functions do nothing. You can override this with a command-line flag:

```bash
node myapp.js --no-color
node myapp.js --color=false

node myapp.js --color
node myapp.js --color=true
node myapp.js --color=always

FORCE_COLOR=1 node myapp.js
```

Or in code:

```javascript
var colors = require('colors');
colors.enable();
colors.disable();
```

## Console.log [string substitution](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data)

```js
var name = 'Marak';
console.log(colors.green('Hello %s'), name);
// outputs -> 'Hello Marak'
```

## Custom themes

### Using standard API

```js

var colors = require('colors');

colors.setTheme({
  silly: 'rainbow',
  input: 'grey',
  verbose: 'cyan',
  prompt: 'grey',
  info: 'green',
  data: 'grey',
  help: 'cyan',
  warn: 'yellow',
  debug: 'blue',
  error: 'red'
});

// outputs red text
console.log("this is an error".error);

// outputs yellow text
console.log("this is a warning".warn);
```

### Using string safe API

```js
var colors = require('colors/safe');

// set single property
var error = colors.red;
error('this is red');

// set theme
colors.setTheme({
  silly: 'rainbow',
  input: 'grey',
  verbose: 'cyan',
  prompt: 'grey',
  info: 'green',
  data: 'grey',
  help: 'cyan',
  warn: 'yellow',
  debug: 'blue',
  error: 'red'
});

// outputs red text
console.log(colors.error("this is an error"));

// outputs yellow text
console.log(colors.warn("this is a warning"));

```

### Combining Colors

```javascript
var colors = require('colors');

colors.setTheme({
  custom: ['red', 'underline']
});

console.log('test'.custom);
```

*Protip: There is a secret undocumented style in `colors`. If you find the style you can summon him.*

### [Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/commander/CHANGELOG.md](Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/commander/CHANGELOG.md)
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). (Format adopted after v3.0.0.)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

- configuration support in `addCommand()` for `hidden` and `isDefault` ([#1232])

### Fixed

- omit masked help flags from the displayed help ([#645], [#1247])
- remove old short help flag when change help flags using `helpOption` ([#1248])

### Changed

- rename `.command()` configuration `noHelp` to `hidden` (but not remove old support) ([#1232])
- improvements to documentation
- update dependencies
- update tested versions of node
- eliminate lint errors in TypeScript ([#1208])

## [5.0.0] (2020-03-14)

### Added

* support for nested commands with action-handlers ([#1] [#764] [#1149])
* `.addCommand()` for adding a separately configured command ([#764] [#1149])
* allow a non-executable to be set as the default command ([#742] [#1149])
* implicit help command when there are subcommands (previously only if executables) ([#1149])
* customise implicit help command with `.addHelpCommand()` ([#1149])
* display error message for unknown subcommand, by default ([#432] [#1088] [#1149])
* display help for missing subcommand, by default ([#1088] [#1149])
* combined short options as single argument may include boolean flags and value flag and value (e.g. `-a -b -p 80` can be written as `-abp80`) ([#1145])
* `.parseOption()` includes short flag and long flag expansions ([#1145])
* `.helpInformation()` returns help text as a string, previously a private routine ([#1169])
* `.parse()` implicitly uses `process.argv` if arguments not specified ([#1172])
* optionally specify where `.parse()` arguments "from", if not following node conventions ([#512] [#1172])
* suggest help option along with unknown command error ([#1179])
* TypeScript definition for `commands` property of `Command` ([#1184])
* export `program` property ([#1195])
* `createCommand` factory method to simplify subclassing ([#1191])

### Fixed

* preserve argument order in subcommands ([#508] [#962] [#1138])
* do not emit `command:*` for executable subcommands ([#809] [#1149])
* action handler called whether or not there are non-option arguments ([#1062] [#1149])
* combining option short flag and value in single argument now works for subcommands ([#1145])
* only add implicit help command when it will not conflict with other uses of argument ([#1153] [#1149])
* implicit help command works with command aliases ([#948] [#1149])
* options are validated whether or not there is an action handler ([#1149])

### Changed

* *Breaking* `.args` contains command arguments with just recognised options removed ([#1032] [#1138])
* *Breaking* display error if required argument for command is missing ([#995] [#1149])
* tighten TypeScript definition of custom option processing function passed to `.option()` ([#1119])
* *Breaking* `.allowUnknownOption()` ([#802] [#1138])
  * unknown options included in arguments passed to command action handler
  * unknown options included in `.args`
* only recognised option short flags and long flags are expanded (e.g. `-ab` or `--foo=bar`) ([#1145])
* *Breaking* `.parseOptions()` ([#1138])
  * `args` in returned result renamed `operands` and does not include anything after first unknown option
  * `unknown` in returned result has arguments after first unknown option including operands, not just options and values
* *Breaking* `.on('command:*', callback)` and other command events passed (changed) results from `.parseOptions`, i.e. operands and unknown  ([#1138])
* refactor Option from prototype to class ([#1133])
* refactor Command from prototype to class ([#1159])
* changes to error handling ([#1165])
  * throw for author error, not just display message
  * preflight for variadic error
  * add tips to missing subcommand executable
* TypeScript fluent return types changed to be more subclass friendly, return `this` rather than `Command` ([#1180])
* `.parseAsync` returns `Promise<this>` to be consistent with `.parse()` ([#1180])
* update dependencies

### Removed

* removed EventEmitter from TypeScript definition for Command, eliminating implicit peer dependency on `@types/node` ([#1146])
* removed private function `normalize` (the functionality has been integrated into `parseOptions`) ([#1145])
* `parseExpectedArgs` is now private ([#1149])

### Migration Tips

If you use `.on('command:*')` or more complicated tests to detect an unrecognised subcommand, you may be able to delete the code and rely on the default behaviour.

If you use `program.args` or more complicated tests to detect a missing subcommand, you may be able to delete the code and rely on the default behaviour.

If you use `.command('*')` to add a default command, you may be be able to switch to `isDefault:true` with a named command.

* rework TypeScript declarations to bring all types into imported namespace ([#1081])

### Migration Tips

#### Testing for no arguments

If you were previously using code like:

```js
if (!program.args.length) ...
```

a partial replacement is:

```js
if (program.rawArgs.length < 3) ...
```

### Fixed

* help for sub commands with custom executableFile ([#1018])

## [3.0.0] / 2019-08-08

* Add option to specify executable file name ([#999])
  * e.g. `.command('clone', 'clone description', { executableFile: 'myClone' })`
* Change docs for `.command` to contrast action handler vs git-style executable. ([#938] [#990])
* **Breaking** Change TypeScript to use overloaded function for `.command`. ([#938] [#990])
* Change to use straight quotes around strings in error messages (like 'this' instead of `this') ([#915])
* Add TypeScript "reference types" for node ([#974])
* Add support for hyphen as an option argument in subcommands ([#697])
* Add support for a short option flag and its value to be concatenated for action handler subcommands ([#599])
  * e.g. `-p 80` can also be supplied as `-p80`
* Add executable arguments to spawn in win32, for git-style executables ([#611])
  * e.g. `node --harmony myCommand.js clone`
* Add parent command as prefix of subcommand in help ([#980])
* Add optional custom description to `.version` ([#963])
  * e.g. `program.version('0.0.1', '-v, --vers', 'output the current version')`
* Add `.helpOption(flags, description)` routine to customise help flags and description ([#963])
  * e.g. `.helpOption('-e, --HELP', 'read more information')`
* Fix behavior of --no-* options ([#795])
  * can now define both `--foo` and `--no-foo`
  * **Breaking** custom event listeners: `--no-foo` on cli now emits `option:no-foo` (previously `option:foo`)
  * **Breaking** default value: defining `--no-foo` after defining `--foo` leaves the default value unchanged (previously set it to false)
  * allow boolean default value, such as from environment ([#987])
* Increment inspector port for spawned subcommands ([#991])
  * e.g. `node --inspect myCommand.js clone`

### Migration Tips

The custom event for a negated option like `--no-foo` is `option:no-foo` (previously `option:foo`).

```js
program
  .option('--no-foo')
  .on('option:no-foo', () => {
    console.log('removing foo');
  });
```

When using TypeScript, adding a command does not allow an explicit `undefined` for an unwanted executable description (e.g
for a command with an action handler).

```js
program
  .command('action1', undefined, { noHelp: true }) // No longer valid
  .command('action2', { noHelp: true }) // Correct
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install commander
```

## Declaring _program_ variable

Commander exports a global object which is convenient for quick programs.
This is used in the examples in this README for brevity.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');
program.version('0.0.1');
```

For larger programs which may use commander in multiple ways, including unit testing, it is better to create a local Command object to use.

 ```js
 const { Command } = require('commander');
 const program = new Command();
 program.version('0.0.1');
 ```

## Options

Options are defined with the `.option()` method, also serving as documentation for the options. Each option can have a short flag (single character) and a long name, separated by a comma or space or vertical bar ('|').

The options can be accessed as properties on the Command object. Multi-word options such as "--template-engine" are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc. See also optional new behaviour to [avoid name clashes](#avoiding-option-name-clashes).

Multiple short flags may optionally be combined in a single argument following the dash: boolean flags, the last flag may take a value, and the value.
For example `-a -b -p 80` may be written as `-ab -p80` or even `-abp80`.

You can use `--` to indicate the end of the options, and any remaining arguments will be used without being interpreted.
This is particularly useful for passing options through to another
command, like: `do -- git --version`.

Options on the command line are not positional, and can be specified before or after other command arguments.

### Common option types, boolean and value

The two most used option types are a boolean flag, and an option which takes a value (declared using angle brackets). Both are `undefined` unless specified on command line.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .option('-d, --debug', 'output extra debugging')
  .option('-s, --small', 'small pizza size')
  .option('-p, --pizza-type <type>', 'flavour of pizza');

program.parse(process.argv);

if (program.debug) console.log(program.opts());
console.log('pizza details:');
if (program.small) console.log('- small pizza size');
if (program.pizzaType) console.log(`- ${program.pizzaType}`);
```

```bash
$ pizza-options -d
{ debug: true, small: undefined, pizzaType: undefined }
pizza details:
$ pizza-options -p
error: option '-p, --pizza-type <type>' argument missing
$ pizza-options -ds -p vegetarian
{ debug: true, small: true, pizzaType: 'vegetarian' }
pizza details:
- small pizza size
- vegetarian
$ pizza-options --pizza-type=cheese
pizza details:
- cheese
```

`program.parse(arguments)` processes the arguments, leaving any args not consumed by the program options in the `program.args` array.

### Default option value

You can specify a default value for an option which takes a value.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .option('-c, --cheese <type>', 'add the specified type of cheese', 'blue');

program.parse(process.argv);

console.log(`cheese: ${program.cheese}`);
```

```bash
$ pizza-options
cheese: blue
$ pizza-options --cheese stilton
cheese: stilton
```

### Other option types, negatable boolean and flag|value

You can specify a boolean option long name with a leading `no-` to set the option value to false when used.
Defined alone this also makes the option true by default.

If you define `--foo` first, adding `--no-foo` does not change the default value from what it would
otherwise be. You can specify a default boolean value for a boolean flag and it can be overridden on command line.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .option('--no-sauce', 'Remove sauce')
  .option('--cheese <flavour>', 'cheese flavour', 'mozzarella')
  .option('--no-cheese', 'plain with no cheese')
  .parse(process.argv);

const sauceStr = program.sauce ? 'sauce' : 'no sauce';
const cheeseStr = (program.cheese === false) ? 'no cheese' : `${program.cheese} cheese`;
console.log(`You ordered a pizza with ${sauceStr} and ${cheeseStr}`);
```

```bash
$ pizza-options
You ordered a pizza with sauce and mozzarella cheese
$ pizza-options --sauce
error: unknown option '--sauce'
$ pizza-options --cheese=blue
You ordered a pizza with sauce and blue cheese
$ pizza-options --no-sauce --no-cheese
You ordered a pizza with no sauce and no cheese
```

You can specify an option which functions as a flag but may also take a value (declared using square brackets).

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .option('-c, --cheese [type]', 'Add cheese with optional type');

program.parse(process.argv);

if (program.cheese === undefined) console.log('no cheese');
else if (program.cheese === true) console.log('add cheese');
else console.log(`add cheese type ${program.cheese}`);
```

```bash
$ pizza-options
no cheese
$ pizza-options --cheese
add cheese
$ pizza-options --cheese mozzarella
add cheese type mozzarella
```

### Custom option processing

You may specify a function to do custom processing of option values. The callback function receives two parameters, the user specified value and the
previous value for the option. It returns the new value for the option.

This allows you to coerce the option value to the desired type, or accumulate values, or do entirely custom processing.

You can optionally specify the default/starting value for the option after the function.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

function myParseInt(value, dummyPrevious) {
  // parseInt takes a string and an optional radix
  return parseInt(value);
}

function increaseVerbosity(dummyValue, previous) {
  return previous + 1;
}

function collect(value, previous) {
  return previous.concat([value]);
}

function commaSeparatedList(value, dummyPrevious) {
  return value.split(',');
}

program
  .option('-f, --float <number>', 'float argument', parseFloat)
  .option('-i, --integer <number>', 'integer argument', myParseInt)
  .option('-v, --verbose', 'verbosity that can be increased', increaseVerbosity, 0)
  .option('-c, --collect <value>', 'repeatable value', collect, [])
  .option('-l, --list <items>', 'comma separated list', commaSeparatedList)
;

program.parse(process.argv);

if (program.float !== undefined) console.log(`float: ${program.float}`);
if (program.integer !== undefined) console.log(`integer: ${program.integer}`);
if (program.verbose > 0) console.log(`verbosity: ${program.verbose}`);
if (program.collect.length > 0) console.log(program.collect);
if (program.list !== undefined) console.log(program.list);
```

```bash
$ custom -f 1e2
float: 100
$ custom --integer 2
integer: 2
$ custom -v -v -v
verbose: 3
$ custom -c a -c b -c c
[ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]
$ custom --list x,y,z
[ 'x', 'y', 'z' ]
```

### Required option

You may specify a required (mandatory) option using `.requiredOption`. The option must have a value after parsing, usually specified on the command line, or perhaps from a default value (say from environment). The method is otherwise the same as `.option` in format, taking flags and description, and optional default value or custom processing.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .requiredOption('-c, --cheese <type>', 'pizza must have cheese');

program.parse(process.argv);
```

```bash
$ pizza
error: required option '-c, --cheese <type>' not specified
```

### Version option

The optional `version` method adds handling for displaying the command version. The default option flags are `-V` and `--version`, and when present the command prints the version number and exits.

```js
program.version('0.0.1');
```

```bash
$ ./examples/pizza -V
0.0.1
```

You may change the flags and description by passing additional parameters to the `version` method, using
the same syntax for flags as the `option` method. The version flags can be named anything, but a long name is required.

```js
program.version('0.0.1', '-v, --vers', 'output the current version');
```

## Commands

You can specify (sub)commands using `.command()` or `.addCommand()`. There are two ways these can be implemented: using an action handler attached to the command, or as a stand-alone executable file (described in more detail later). The subcommands may be nested ([example](./examples/nestedCommands.js)).

In the first parameter to `.command()` you specify the command name and any command arguments. The arguments may be `<required>` or `[optional]`, and the last argument may also be `variadic...`.

You can use `.addCommand()` to add an already configured subcommand to the program.

For example:

```js
// Command implemented using action handler (description is supplied separately to `.command`)
// Returns new command for configuring.
program
  .command('clone <source> [destination]')
  .description('clone a repository into a newly created directory')
  .action((source, destination) => {
    console.log('clone command called');
  });

// Command implemented using stand-alone executable file (description is second parameter to `.command`)
// Returns `this` for adding more commands.
program
  .command('start <service>', 'start named service')
  .command('stop [service]', 'stop named service, or all if no name supplied');

// Command prepared separately.
// Returns `this` for adding more commands.
program
  .addCommand(build.makeBuildCommand());
```

Configuration options can be passed with the call to `.command()` and `.addCommand()`. Specifying `true` for `opts.hidden` will remove the command from the generated help output. Specifying `true` for `opts.isDefault` will run the subcommand if no other subcommand is specified ([example](./examples/defaultCommand.js)).

### Specify the argument syntax

You use `.arguments` to specify the arguments for the top-level command, and for subcommands they are usually included in the `.command` call. Angled brackets (e.g. `<required>`) indicate required input. Square brackets (e.g. `[optional]`) indicate optional input.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .arguments('<cmd> [env]')
  .action(function (cmd, env) {
    cmdValue = cmd;
    envValue = env;
  });

program.parse(process.argv);

if (typeof cmdValue === 'undefined') {
  console.error('no command given!');
  process.exit(1);
}
console.log('command:', cmdValue);
console.log('environment:', envValue || "no environment given");
```

 The last argument of a command can be variadic, and only the last argument.  To make an argument variadic you
 append `...` to the argument name. For example:

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .command('rmdir <dir> [otherDirs...]')
  .action(function (dir, otherDirs) {
    console.log('rmdir %s', dir);
    if (otherDirs) {
      otherDirs.forEach(function (oDir) {
        console.log('rmdir %s', oDir);
      });
    }
  });

program.parse(process.argv);
```

The variadic argument is passed to the action handler as an array.

### Action handler (sub)commands

You can add options to a command that uses an action handler.
The action handler gets passed a parameter for each argument you declared, and one additional argument which is the
command object itself. This command argument has the values for the command-specific options added as properties.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .command('rm <dir>')
  .option('-r, --recursive', 'Remove recursively')
  .action(function (dir, cmdObj) {
    console.log('remove ' + dir + (cmdObj.recursive ? ' recursively' : ''))
  })

program.parse(process.argv)
```

You may supply an `async` action handler, in which case you call `.parseAsync` rather than `.parse`.

```js
async function run() { /* code goes here */ }

async function main() {
  program
    .command('run')
    .action(run);
  await program.parseAsync(process.argv);
}
```

A command's options on the command line are validated when the command is used. Any unknown options will be reported as an error.

### Stand-alone executable (sub)commands

When `.command()` is invoked with a description argument, this tells Commander that you're going to use stand-alone executables for subcommands.
Commander will search the executables in the directory of the entry script (like `./examples/pm`) with the name `program-subcommand`, like `pm-install`, `pm-search`.
You can specify a custom name with the `executableFile` configuration option.

You handle the options for an executable (sub)command in the executable, and don't declare them at the top-level.

```js
// file: ./examples/pm
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .command('install [name]', 'install one or more packages')
  .command('search [query]', 'search with optional query')
  .command('update', 'update installed packages', {executableFile: 'myUpdateSubCommand'})
  .command('list', 'list packages installed', {isDefault: true})
  .parse(process.argv);
```

If the program is designed to be installed globally, make sure the executables have proper modes, like `755`.

## Automated help

The help information is auto-generated based on the information commander already knows about your program. The default
help option is `-h,--help`. ([example](./examples/pizza))

```bash
$ node ./examples/pizza --help
Usage: pizza [options]

An application for pizzas ordering

Options:
  -V, --version        output the version number
  -p, --peppers        Add peppers
  -c, --cheese <type>  Add the specified type of cheese (default: "marble")
  -C, --no-cheese      You do not want any cheese
  -h, --help           display help for command
```

A `help` command is added by default if your command has subcommands. It can be used alone, or with a subcommand name to show
further help for the subcommand. These are effectively the same if the `shell` program has implicit help:

```bash
shell help
shell --help

shell help spawn
shell spawn --help
```

### Custom help

You can display extra information by listening for "--help". ([example](./examples/custom-help))

```js
program
  .option('-f, --foo', 'enable some foo');

// must be before .parse()
program.on('--help', () => {
  console.log('');
  console.log('Example call:');
  console.log('  $ custom-help --help');
});
```

Yields the following help output:

```Text
Usage: custom-help [options]

Options:
  -f, --foo   enable some foo
  -h, --help  display help for command

Example call:
  $ custom-help --help
```

### .usage and .name

These allow you to customise the usage description in the first line of the help. The name is otherwise
deduced from the (full) program arguments. Given:

```js
program
  .name("my-command")
  .usage("[global options] command")
```

The help will start with:

```Text
Usage: my-command [global options] command
```

### .help(cb)

Output help information and exit immediately. Optional callback cb allows post-processing of help text before it is displayed.

### .outputHelp(cb)

Output help information without exiting.
Optional callback cb allows post-processing of help text before it is displayed.

### .helpInformation()

Get the command help information as a string for processing or displaying yourself. (The text does not include the custom help
from `--help` listeners.)

### .helpOption(flags, description)

Override the default help flags and description.

```js
program
  .helpOption('-e, --HELP', 'read more information');
```

### .addHelpCommand()

You can explicitly turn on or off the implicit help command with `.addHelpCommand()` and `.addHelpCommand(false)`.

You can both turn on and customise the help command by supplying the name and description:

```js
program.addHelpCommand('assist [command]', 'show assistance');
```

## Custom event listeners

You can execute custom actions by listening to command and option events.

```js
program.on('option:verbose', function () {
  process.env.VERBOSE = this.verbose;
});

program.on('command:*', function (operands) {
  console.error(`error: unknown command '${operands[0]}'`);
  const availableCommands = program.commands.map(cmd => cmd.name());
  mySuggestBestMatch(operands[0], availableCommands);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

## Bits and pieces

### .parse() and .parseAsync()

The first argument to `.parse` is the array of strings to parse. You may omit the parameter to implicitly use `process.argv`.

If the arguments follow different conventions than node you can pass a `from` option in the second parameter:

- 'node': default, `argv[0]` is the application and `argv[1]` is the script being run, with user parameters after that
- 'electron': `argv[1]` varies depending on whether the electron application is packaged
- 'user': all of the arguments from the user

For example:

```js
program.parse(process.argv); // Explicit, node conventions
program.parse(); // Implicit, and auto-detect electron
program.parse(['-f', 'filename'], { from: 'user' });
```

### Avoiding option name clashes

The original and default behaviour is that the option values are stored
as properties on the program, and the action handler is passed a
command object with the options values stored as properties.
This is very convenient to code, but the downside is possible clashes with
existing properties of Command.

There are two new routines to change the behaviour, and the default behaviour may change in the future:

- `storeOptionsAsProperties`: whether to store option values as properties on command object, or store separately (specify false) and access using `.opts()`
- `passCommandToAction`: whether to pass command to action handler,
or just the options (specify false)

([example](./examples/storeOptionsAsProperties-action.js))

```js
program
  .storeOptionsAsProperties(false)
  .passCommandToAction(false);

program
  .name('my-program-name')
  .option('-n,--name <name>');

program
  .command('show')
  .option('-a,--action <action>')
  .action((options) => {
    console.log(options.action);
  });

program.parse(process.argv);

const programOptions = program.opts();
console.log(programOptions.name);
```

### TypeScript

The Commander package includes its TypeScript Definition file.

If you use `ts-node` and  stand-alone executable subcommands written as `.ts` files, you need to call your program through node to get the subcommands called correctly. e.g.

```bash
node -r ts-node/register pm.ts
```

### createCommand()

This factory function creates a new command. It is exported and may be used instead of using `new`, like:

```js
const { createCommand } = require('commander');
const program = createCommand();
```

`createCommand` is also a method of the Command object, and creates a new command rather than a subcommand. This gets used internally
when creating subcommands using `.command()`, and you may override it to
customise the new subcommand (examples using [subclass](./examples/custom-command-class.js) and [function](./examples/custom-command-function.js)).

### Node options such as `--harmony`

You can enable `--harmony` option in two ways:

- Use `#! /usr/bin/env node --harmony` in the subcommands scripts. (Note Windows does not support this pattern.)
- Use the `--harmony` option when call the command, like `node --harmony examples/pm publish`. The `--harmony` option will be preserved when spawning subcommand process.

### Debugging stand-alone executable subcommands

An executable subcommand is launched as a separate child process.

If you are using the node inspector for [debugging](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/) executable subcommands using `node --inspect` et al,
the inspector port is incremented by 1 for the spawned subcommand.

If you are using VSCode to debug executable subcommands you need to set the `"autoAttachChildProcesses": true` flag in your launch.json configuration.

### Override exit handling

By default Commander calls `process.exit` when it detects errors, or after displaying the help or version. You can override
this behaviour and optionally supply a callback. The default override throws a `CommanderError`.

The override callback is passed a `CommanderError` with properties `exitCode` number, `code` string, and `message`. The default override behaviour is to throw the error, except for async handling of executable subcommand completion which carries on. The normal display of error messages or version or help
is not affected by the override which is called after the display.

``` js
program.exitOverride();

try {
  program.parse(process.argv);
} catch (err) {
  // custom processing...
}
```

## Examples

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .option('-C, --chdir <path>', 'change the working directory')
  .option('-c, --config <path>', 'set config path. defaults to ./deploy.conf')
  .option('-T, --no-tests', 'ignore test hook');

program
  .command('setup [env]')
  .description('run setup commands for all envs')
  .option("-s, --setup_mode [mode]", "Which setup mode to use")
  .action(function(env, options){
    const mode = options.setup_mode || "normal";
    env = env || 'all';
    console.log('setup for %s env(s) with %s mode', env, mode);
  });

program
  .command('exec <cmd>')
  .alias('ex')
  .description('execute the given remote cmd')
  .option("-e, --exec_mode <mode>", "Which exec mode to use")
  .action(function(cmd, options){
    console.log('exec "%s" using %s mode', cmd, options.exec_mode);
  }).on('--help', function() {
    console.log('');
    console.log('Examples:');
    console.log('');
    console.log('  $ deploy exec sequential');
    console.log('  $ deploy exec async');
  });

program.parse(process.argv);
```

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/szmarczak/defer-to-connect/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/szmarczak/defer-to-connect?branch=master)

Once you receive the socket, it may be already connected (or disconnected).<br>
To avoid checking that, use `defer-to-connect`. It'll do that for you.

## Usage

```js
const deferToConnect = require('defer-to-connect');

deferToConnect(socket, () => {
    console.log('Connected!');
});
```

## API

### deferToConnect(socket, connectListener)

Calls `connectListener()` when connected.

### deferToConnect(socket, listeners)

#### listeners

An object representing `connect`, `secureConnect` and `close` properties.

Calls `connect()` when the socket is connected.<br>
Calls `secureConnect()` when the socket is securely connected.<br>

Like [duplexer2](https://github.com/deoxxa/duplexer2) but using Streams3 without readable-stream dependency

```javascript
var stream = require("stream");

var duplexer3 = require("duplexer3");

var writable = new stream.Writable({objectMode: true}),
    readable = new stream.Readable({objectMode: true});

writable._write = function _write(input, encoding, done) {
  if (readable.push(input)) {
    return done();
  } else {
    readable.once("drain", done);
  }
};

readable._read = function _read(n) {
  // no-op
};

// simulate the readable thing closing after a bit
writable.once("finish", function() {
  setTimeout(function() {
    readable.push(null);
  }, 500);
});

var duplex = duplexer3(writable, readable);

duplex.on("data", function(e) {
  console.log("got data", JSON.stringify(e));
});

duplex.on("finish", function() {
  console.log("got finish event");
});

duplex.on("end", function() {
  console.log("got end event");
});

duplex.write("oh, hi there", function() {
  console.log("finished writing");
});

duplex.end(function() {
  console.log("finished ending");
});
```

```
got data "oh, hi there"
finished writing
got finish event
finished ending
got end event
```

## Overview

This is a reimplementation of [duplexer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/duplexer) using the
Streams3 API which is standard in Node as of v4. Everything largely
works the same.



## Installation

[Available via `npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

```
$ npm i duplexer3
```

## API

### duplexer3

Creates a new `DuplexWrapper` object, which is the actual class that implements
most of the fun stuff. All that fun stuff is hidden. DON'T LOOK.

```javascript
duplexer3([options], writable, readable)
```

```javascript
const duplex = duplexer3(new stream.Writable(), new stream.Readable());
```

Arguments

* __options__ - an object specifying the regular `stream.Duplex` options, as
  well as the properties described below.
* __writable__ - a writable stream
* __readable__ - a readable stream

Options

* __bubbleErrors__ - a boolean value that specifies whether to bubble errors
  from the underlying readable/writable streams. Default is `true`.

### [Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/emoji-regex/README.md](Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/emoji-regex/README.md)
# emoji-regex [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/mathiasbynens/emoji-regex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mathiasbynens/emoji-regex)

_emoji-regex_ offers a regular expression to match all emoji symbols (including textual representations of emoji) as per the Unicode Standard.

This repository contains a script that generates this regular expression based on [the data from Unicode v12](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/unicode-12.0.0). Because of this, the regular expression can easily be updated whenever new emoji are added to the Unicode standard.

## Installation

Via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install emoji-regex
```

In [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/):

```js
const emojiRegex = require('emoji-regex');
// Note: because the regular expression has the global flag set, this module
// exports a function that returns the regex rather than exporting the regular
// expression itself, to make it impossible to (accidentally) mutate the
// original regular expression.

const text = `
\u{231A}: ⌚ default emoji presentation character (Emoji_Presentation)
\u{2194}\u{FE0F}: ↔️ default text presentation character rendered as emoji
\u{1F469}: 👩 emoji modifier base (Emoji_Modifier_Base)
\u{1F469}\u{1F3FF}: 👩🏿 emoji modifier base followed by a modifier
`;

const regex = emojiRegex();
let match;
while (match = regex.exec(text)) {
  const emoji = match[0];
  console.log(`Matched sequence ${ emoji } — code points: ${ [...emoji].length }`);
}
```

Console output:

```
Matched sequence ⌚ — code points: 1
Matched sequence ⌚ — code points: 1
Matched sequence ↔️ — code points: 2
Matched sequence ↔️ — code points: 2
Matched sequence 👩 — code points: 1
Matched sequence 👩 — code points: 1
Matched sequence 👩🏿 — code points: 2
Matched sequence 👩🏿 — code points: 2
```

To match emoji in their textual representation as well (i.e. emoji that are not `Emoji_Presentation` symbols and that aren’t forced to render as emoji by a variation selector), `require` the other regex:

```js
const emojiRegex = require('emoji-regex/text.js');
```

Additionally, in environments which support ES2015 Unicode escapes, you may `require` ES2015-style versions of the regexes:

```js
const emojiRegex = require('emoji-regex/es2015/index.js');
const emojiRegexText = require('emoji-regex/es2015/text.js');
```

### [Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/end-of-stream/README.md](Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/end-of-stream/README.md)
# end-of-stream

A node module that calls a callback when a readable/writable/duplex stream has completed or failed.

	npm install end-of-stream

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/mafintosh/end-of-stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mafintosh/end-of-stream)

## Usage

Simply pass a stream and a callback to the `eos`.
Both legacy streams, streams2 and stream3 are supported.

``` js
var eos = require('end-of-stream');

eos(readableStream, function(err) {
  // this will be set to the stream instance
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has ended', this === readableStream);
});

eos(writableStream, function(err) {
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has finished', this === writableStream);
});

eos(duplexStream, function(err) {
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has ended and finished', this === duplexStream);
});

eos(duplexStream, {readable:false}, function(err) {
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has finished but might still be readable');
});

eos(duplexStream, {writable:false}, function(err) {
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has ended but might still be writable');
});

eos(readableStream, {error:false}, function(err) {
	// do not treat emit('error', err) as a end-of-stream
});
```

# fast-glob

> It's a very fast and efficient [glob][glob_definition] library for [Node.js][node_js].

This package provides methods for traversing the file system and returning pathnames that matched a defined set of a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix Bash shell with some simplifications, meanwhile results are returned in **arbitrary order**. Quick, simple, effective.

## Old and modern mode

This package works in two modes, depending on the environment in which it is used.

* **Old mode**. Node.js below 10.10 or when the [`stats`](#stats) option is *enabled*.
* **Modern mode**. Node.js 10.10+ and the [`stats`](#stats) option is *disabled*.

The modern mode is faster. Learn more about the [internal mechanism][nodelib_fs_scandir_old_and_modern_modern].

## Pattern syntax

> :warning: Always use forward-slashes in glob expressions (patterns and [`ignore`](#ignore) option). Use backslashes for escaping characters.

There is more than one form of syntax: basic and advanced. Below is a brief overview of the supported features. Also pay attention to our [FAQ](#faq).

> :book: This package uses a [`micromatch`][micromatch] as a library for pattern matching.

### Basic syntax

* An asterisk (`*`) — matches everything except slashes (path separators), hidden files (names starting with `.`).
* A double star or globstar (`**`) — matches zero or more directories.
* Question mark (`?`) – matches any single character except slashes (path separators).
* Sequence (`[seq]`) — matches any character in sequence.

> :book: A few additional words about the [basic matching behavior][picomatch_matching_behavior].

Some examples:

* `src/**/*.js` — matches all files in the `src` directory (any level of nesting) that have the `.js` extension.
* `src/*.??` — matches all files in the `src` directory (only first level of nesting) that have a two-character extension.
* `file-[01].js` — matches files: `file-0.js`, `file-1.js`.

### Advanced syntax

* [Escapes characters][micromatch_backslashes] (`\\`) — matching special characters (`$^*+?()[]`) as literals.
* [POSIX character classes][picomatch_posix_brackets] (`[[:digit:]]`).
* [Extended globs][micromatch_extglobs] (`?(pattern-list)`).
* [Bash style brace expansions][micromatch_braces] (`{}`).
* [Regexp character classes][micromatch_regex_character_classes] (`[1-5]`).
* [Regex groups][regular_expressions_brackets] (`(a|b)`).

> :book: A few additional words about the [advanced matching behavior][micromatch_extended_globbing].

Some examples:

* `src/**/*.{css,scss}` — matches all files in the `src` directory (any level of nesting) that have the `.css` or `.scss` extension.
* `file-[[:digit:]].js` — matches files: `file-0.js`, `file-1.js`, …, `file-9.js`.
* `file-{1..3}.js` — matches files: `file-1.js`, `file-2.js`, `file-3.js`.
* `file-(1|2)` — matches files: `file-1.js`, `file-2.js`.

## Installation

```console
npm install fast-glob
```

## API

### Asynchronous

```js
fg(patterns, [options])
```

Returns a `Promise` with an array of matching entries.

```js
const fg = require('fast-glob');

const entries = await fg(['.editorconfig', '**/index.js'], { dot: true });

// ['.editorconfig', 'services/index.js']
```

### Synchronous

```js
fg.sync(patterns, [options])
```

Returns an array of matching entries.

```js
const fg = require('fast-glob');

const entries = fg.sync(['.editorconfig', '**/index.js'], { dot: true });

// ['.editorconfig', 'services/index.js']
```

### Stream

```js
fg.stream(patterns, [options])
```

Returns a [`ReadableStream`][node_js_stream_readable_streams] when the `data` event will be emitted with matching entry.

```js
const fg = require('fast-glob');

const stream = fg.stream(['.editorconfig', '**/index.js'], { dot: true });

for await (const entry of stream) {
	// .editorconfig
	// services/index.js
}
```

#### patterns

* Required: `true`
* Type: `string | string[]`

Any correct pattern(s).

> :1234: [Pattern syntax](#pattern-syntax)
>
> :warning: This package does not respect the order of patterns. First, all the negative patterns are applied, and only then the positive patterns. If you want to get a certain order of records, use sorting or split calls.

#### [options]

* Required: `false`
* Type: [`Options`](#options-3)

See [Options](#options-3) section.

### Helpers

#### `generateTasks(patterns, [options])`

Returns the internal representation of patterns ([`Task`](./src/managers/tasks.ts) is a combining patterns by base directory).

```js
fg.generateTasks('*');

[{
    base: '.', // Parent directory for all patterns inside this task
    dynamic: true, // Dynamic or static patterns are in this task
    patterns: ['*'],
    positive: ['*'],
    negative: []
}]
```

##### patterns

* Required: `true`
* Type: `string | string[]`

Any correct pattern(s).

##### [options]

* Required: `false`
* Type: [`Options`](#options-3)

See [Options](#options-3) section.

#### `isDynamicPattern(pattern, [options])`

Returns `true` if the passed pattern is a dynamic pattern.

> :1234: [What is a static or dynamic pattern?](#what-is-a-static-or-dynamic-pattern)

```js
fg.isDynamicPattern('*'); // true
fg.isDynamicPattern('abc'); // false
```

##### pattern

* Required: `true`
* Type: `string`

Any correct pattern.

##### [options]

* Required: `false`
* Type: [`Options`](#options-3)

See [Options](#options-3) section.

#### `escapePath(pattern)`

Returns a path with escaped special characters (`*?|(){}[]`, `!` at the beginning of line, `@+!` before the opening parenthesis).

```js
fg.escapePath('!abc'); // \\!abc
fg.escapePath('C:/Program Files (x86)'); // C:/Program Files \\(x86\\)
```

##### pattern

* Required: `true`
* Type: `string`

Any string, for example, a path to a file.

## Options

### Common options

#### concurrency

* Type: `number`
* Default: `os.cpus().length`

Specifies the maximum number of concurrent requests from a reader to read directories.

> :book: The higher the number, the higher the performance and load on the file system. If you want to read in quiet mode, set the value to a comfortable number or `1`.

#### cwd

* Type: `string`
* Default: `process.cwd()`

The current working directory in which to search.

#### deep

* Type: `number`
* Default: `Infinity`

Specifies the maximum depth of a read directory relative to the start directory.

For example, you have the following tree:

```js
dir/
└── one/            // 1
    └── two/        // 2
        └── file.js // 3
```

```js
// With base directory
fg.sync('dir/**', { onlyFiles: false, deep: 1 }); // ['dir/one']
fg.sync('dir/**', { onlyFiles: false, deep: 2 }); // ['dir/one', 'dir/one/two']

// With cwd option
fg.sync('**', { onlyFiles: false, cwd: 'dir', deep: 1 }); // ['one']
fg.sync('**', { onlyFiles: false, cwd: 'dir', deep: 2 }); // ['one', 'one/two']
```

> :book: If you specify a pattern with some base directory, this directory will not participate in the calculation of the depth of the found directories. Think of it as a [`cwd`](#cwd) option.

#### followSymbolicLinks

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Indicates whether to traverse descendants of symbolic link directories.

> :book: If the [`stats`](#stats) option is specified, the information about the symbolic link (`fs.lstat`) will be replaced with information about the entry (`fs.stat`) behind it.

#### fs

* Type: `FileSystemAdapter`
* Default: `fs.*`

Custom implementation of methods for working with the file system.

```ts
export interface FileSystemAdapter {
    lstat?: typeof fs.lstat;
    stat?: typeof fs.stat;
    lstatSync?: typeof fs.lstatSync;
    statSync?: typeof fs.statSync;
    readdir?: typeof fs.readdir;
    readdirSync?: typeof fs.readdirSync;
}
```

#### ignore

* Type: `string[]`
* Default: `[]`

An array of glob patterns to exclude matches. This is an alternative way to use negative patterns.

```js
dir/
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
```

```js
fg.sync(['*.json', '!package-lock.json']);            // ['package.json']
fg.sync('*.json', { ignore: ['package-lock.json'] }); // ['package.json']
```

#### suppressErrors

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

By default this package suppress only `ENOENT` errors. Set to `true` to suppress any error.

> :book: Can be useful when the directory has entries with a special level of access.

#### throwErrorOnBrokenSymbolicLink

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Throw an error when symbolic link is broken if `true` or safely return `lstat` call if `false`.

> :book: This option has no effect on errors when reading the symbolic link directory.

### Output control

#### absolute

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Return the absolute path for entries.

```js
fg.sync('*.js', { absolute: false }); // ['index.js']
fg.sync('*.js', { absolute: true });  // ['/home/user/index.js']
```

> :book: This option is required if you want to use negative patterns with absolute path, for example, `!${__dirname}/*.js`.

#### markDirectories

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Mark the directory path with the final slash.

```js
fg.sync('*', { onlyFiles: false, markDirectories: false }); // ['index.js', 'controllers']
fg.sync('*', { onlyFiles: false, markDirectories: true });  // ['index.js', 'controllers/']
```

#### objectMode

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Returns objects (instead of strings) describing entries.

```js
fg.sync('*', { objectMode: false }); // ['src/index.js']
fg.sync('*', { objectMode: true });  // [{ name: 'index.js', path: 'src/index.js', dirent: <fs.Dirent> }]
```

The object has the following fields:

* name (`string`) — the last part of the path (basename)
* path (`string`) — full path relative to the pattern base directory
* dirent ([`fs.Dirent`][node_js_fs_class_fs_dirent]) — instance of `fs.Direct`

> :book: An object is an internal representation of entry, so getting it does not affect performance.

#### onlyDirectories

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Return only directories.

```js
fg.sync('*', { onlyDirectories: false }); // ['index.js', 'src']
fg.sync('*', { onlyDirectories: true });  // ['src']
```

> :book: If `true`, the [`onlyFiles`](#onlyfiles) option is automatically `false`.

#### onlyFiles

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Return only files.

```js
fg.sync('*', { onlyFiles: false }); // ['index.js', 'src']
fg.sync('*', { onlyFiles: true });  // ['index.js']
```

#### stats

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Enables an [object mode](#objectmode) with an additional field:

* stats ([`fs.Stats`][node_js_fs_class_fs_stats]) — instance of `fs.Stats`

```js
fg.sync('*', { stats: false }); // ['src/index.js']
fg.sync('*', { stats: true });  // [{ name: 'index.js', path: 'src/index.js', dirent: <fs.Dirent>, stats: <fs.Stats> }]
```

> :book: Returns `fs.stat` instead of `fs.lstat` for symbolic links when the [`followSymbolicLinks`](#followsymboliclinks) option is specified.
>
> :warning: Unlike [object mode](#objectmode) this mode requires additional calls to the file system. On average, this mode is slower at least twice. See [old and modern mode](#old-and-modern-mode) for more details.

#### unique

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Ensures that the returned entries are unique.

```js
fg.sync(['*.json', 'package.json'], { unique: false }); // ['package.json', 'package.json']
fg.sync(['*.json', 'package.json'], { unique: true });  // ['package.json']
```

If `true` and similar entries are found, the result is the first found.

### Matching control

#### braceExpansion

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Enables Bash-like brace expansion.

> :1234: [Syntax description][bash_hackers_syntax_expansion_brace] or more [detailed description][micromatch_braces].

```js
dir/
├── abd
├── acd
└── a{b,c}d
```

```js
fg.sync('a{b,c}d', { braceExpansion: false }); // ['a{b,c}d']
fg.sync('a{b,c}d', { braceExpansion: true });  // ['abd', 'acd']
```

#### caseSensitiveMatch

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Enables a [case-sensitive][wikipedia_case_sensitivity] mode for matching files.

```js
dir/
├── file.txt
└── File.txt
```

```js
fg.sync('file.txt', { caseSensitiveMatch: false }); // ['file.txt', 'File.txt']
fg.sync('file.txt', { caseSensitiveMatch: true });  // ['file.txt']
```

#### dot

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Allow patterns to match entries that begin with a period (`.`).

> :book: Note that an explicit dot in a portion of the pattern will always match dot files.

```js
dir/
├── .editorconfig
└── package.json
```

```js
fg.sync('*', { dot: false }); // ['package.json']
fg.sync('*', { dot: true });  // ['.editorconfig', 'package.json']
```

#### extglob

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Enables Bash-like `extglob` functionality.

> :1234: [Syntax description][micromatch_extglobs].

```js
dir/
├── README.md
└── package.json
```

```js
fg.sync('*.+(json|md)', { extglob: false }); // []
fg.sync('*.+(json|md)', { extglob: true });  // ['README.md', 'package.json']
```

#### globstar

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Enables recursively repeats a pattern containing `**`. If `false`, `**` behaves exactly like `*`.

```js
dir/
└── a
    └── b
```

```js
fg.sync('**', { onlyFiles: false, globstar: false }); // ['a']
fg.sync('**', { onlyFiles: false, globstar: true });  // ['a', 'a/b']
```

#### baseNameMatch

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

If set to `true`, then patterns without slashes will be matched against the basename of the path if it contains slashes.

```js
dir/
└── one/
    └── file.md
```

```js
fg.sync('*.md', { baseNameMatch: false }); // []
fg.sync('*.md', { baseNameMatch: true });  // ['one/file.md']
```

## FAQ

## What is a static or dynamic pattern?

All patterns can be divided into two types:

* **static**. A pattern is considered static if it can be used to get an entry on the file system without using matching mechanisms. For example, the `file.js` pattern is a static pattern because we can just verify that it exists on the file system.
* **dynamic**. A pattern is considered dynamic if it cannot be used directly to find occurrences without using a matching mechanisms. For example, the `*` pattern is a dynamic pattern because we cannot use this pattern directly.

A pattern is considered dynamic if it contains the following characters (`…` — any characters or their absence) or options:

* The [`caseSensitiveMatch`](#casesensitivematch) option is disabled
* `\\` (the escape character)
* `*`, `?`, `!` (at the beginning of line)
* `[…]`
* `(…|…)`
* `@(…)`, `!(…)`, `*(…)`, `?(…)`, `+(…)` (respects the [`extglob`](#extglob) option)
* `{…,…}`, `{…..…}` (respects the [`braceExpansion`](#braceexpansion) option)

## How to write patterns on Windows?

Always use forward-slashes in glob expressions (patterns and [`ignore`](#ignore) option). Use backslashes for escaping characters. With the [`cwd`](#cwd) option use a convenient format.

**Bad**

```ts
[
	'directory\\*',
	path.join(process.cwd(), '**')
]
```

**Good**

```ts
[
	'directory/*',
	path.join(process.cwd(), '**').replace(/\\/g, '/')
]
```

> :book: Use the [`normalize-path`][npm_normalize_path] or the [`unixify`][npm_unixify] package to convert Windows-style path to a Unix-style path.

Read more about [matching with backslashes][micromatch_backslashes].

## Why are parentheses match wrong?

```js
dir/
└── (special-*file).txt
```

```js
fg.sync(['(special-*file).txt']) // []
```

Refers to Bash. You need to escape special characters:

```js
fg.sync(['\\(special-*file\\).txt']) // ['(special-*file).txt']
```

Read more about [matching special characters as literals][picomatch_matching_special_characters_as_literals].

## How to exclude directory from reading?

You can use a negative pattern like this: `!**/node_modules` or `!**/node_modules/**`. Also you can use [`ignore`](#ignore) option. Just look at the example below.

```js
first/
├── file.md
└── second/
    └── file.txt
```

If you don't want to read the `second` directory, you must write the following pattern: `!**/second` or `!**/second/**`.

```js
fg.sync(['**/*.md', '!**/second']);                 // ['first/file.md']
fg.sync(['**/*.md'], { ignore: ['**/second/**'] }); // ['first/file.md']
```

> :warning: When you write `!**/second/**/*` it means that the directory will be **read**, but all the entries will not be included in the results.

You have to understand that if you write the pattern to exclude directories, then the directory will not be read under any circumstances.

## How to use UNC path?

You cannot use [Uniform Naming Convention (UNC)][unc_path] paths as patterns (due to syntax), but you can use them as [`cwd`](#cwd) directory.

```ts
fg.sync('*', { cwd: '\\\\?\\C:\\Python27' /* or //?/C:/Python27 */ });
fg.sync('Python27/*', { cwd: '\\\\?\\C:\\' /* or //?/C:/ */ });
```

## Compatible with `node-glob`?

| node-glob    | fast-glob |
| :----------: | :-------: |
| `cwd`        | [`cwd`](#cwd) |
| `root`       | – |

> Fill in a range of numbers or letters, optionally passing an increment or `step` to use, or create a regex-compatible range with `options.toRegex`

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save fill-range
```

## Usage

Expands numbers and letters, optionally using a `step` as the last argument. _(Numbers may be defined as JavaScript numbers or strings)_.

```js
const fill = require('fill-range');
// fill(from, to[, step, options]);

console.log(fill('1', '10')); //=> ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10']
console.log(fill('1', '10', { toRegex: true })); //=> [1-9]|10
```

**Params**

* `from`: **{String|Number}** the number or letter to start with
* `to`: **{String|Number}** the number or letter to end with
* `step`: **{String|Number|Object|Function}** Optionally pass a [step](#optionsstep) to use.
* `options`: **{Object|Function}**: See all available [options](#options)

## Examples

By default, an array of values is returned.

**Alphabetical ranges**

```js
console.log(fill('a', 'e')); //=> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
console.log(fill('A', 'E')); //=> [ 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E' ]
```

**Numerical ranges**

Numbers can be defined as actual numbers or strings.

```js
console.log(fill(1, 5));     //=> [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
console.log(fill('1', '5')); //=> [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
```

**Negative ranges**

Numbers can be defined as actual numbers or strings.

```js
console.log(fill('-5', '-1')); //=> [ '-5', '-4', '-3', '-2', '-1' ]
console.log(fill('-5', '5')); //=> [ '-5', '-4', '-3', '-2', '-1', '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5' ]
```

**Steps (increments)**

```js
// numerical ranges with increments
console.log(fill('0', '25', 4)); //=> [ '0', '4', '8', '12', '16', '20', '24' ]
console.log(fill('0', '25', 5)); //=> [ '0', '5', '10', '15', '20', '25' ]
console.log(fill('0', '25', 6)); //=> [ '0', '6', '12', '18', '24' ]

// alphabetical ranges with increments
console.log(fill('a', 'z', 4)); //=> [ 'a', 'e', 'i', 'm', 'q', 'u', 'y' ]
console.log(fill('a', 'z', 5)); //=> [ 'a', 'f', 'k', 'p', 'u', 'z' ]
console.log(fill('a', 'z', 6)); //=> [ 'a', 'g', 'm', 's', 'y' ]
```

## Options

### options.step

**Type**: `number` (formatted as a string or number)

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: The increment to use for the range. Can be used with letters or numbers.

**Example(s)**

```js
// numbers
console.log(fill('1', '10', 2)); //=> [ '1', '3', '5', '7', '9' ]
console.log(fill('1', '10', 3)); //=> [ '1', '4', '7', '10' ]
console.log(fill('1', '10', 4)); //=> [ '1', '5', '9' ]

// letters
console.log(fill('a', 'z', 5)); //=> [ 'a', 'f', 'k', 'p', 'u', 'z' ]
console.log(fill('a', 'z', 7)); //=> [ 'a', 'h', 'o', 'v' ]
console.log(fill('a', 'z', 9)); //=> [ 'a', 'j', 's' ]
```

### options.strictRanges

**Type**: `boolean`

**Default**: `false`

**Description**: By default, `null` is returned when an invalid range is passed. Enable this option to throw a `RangeError` on invalid ranges.

**Example(s)**

The following are all invalid:

```js
fill('1.1', '2');   // decimals not supported in ranges
fill('a', '2');     // incompatible range values
fill(1, 10, 'foo'); // invalid "step" argument
```

### options.stringify

**Type**: `boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: Cast all returned values to strings. By default, integers are returned as numbers.

**Example(s)**

```js
console.log(fill(1, 5));                    //=> [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
console.log(fill(1, 5, { stringify: true })); //=> [ '1', '2', '3', '4', '5' ]
```

### options.toRegex

**Type**: `boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: Create a regex-compatible source string, instead of expanding values to an array.

**Example(s)**

```js
// alphabetical range
console.log(fill('a', 'e', { toRegex: true })); //=> '[a-e]'
// alphabetical with step
console.log(fill('a', 'z', 3, { toRegex: true })); //=> 'a|d|g|j|m|p|s|v|y'
// numerical range
console.log(fill('1', '100', { toRegex: true })); //=> '[1-9]|[1-9][0-9]|100'
// numerical range with zero padding
console.log(fill('000001', '100000', { toRegex: true }));
//=> '0{5}[1-9]|0{4}[1-9][0-9]|0{3}[1-9][0-9]{2}|0{2}[1-9][0-9]{3}|0[1-9][0-9]{4}|100000'
```

### options.transform

**Type**: `function`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: Customize each value in the returned array (or [string](#optionstoRegex)). _(you can also pass this function as the last argument to `fill()`)_.

**Example(s)**

```js
// add zero padding
console.log(fill(1, 5, value => String(value).padStart(4, '0')));
//=> ['0001', '0002', '0003', '0004', '0005']
```

```js
const path = require('path');
const findUp = require('find-up');

(async () => {
	console.log(await findUp('unicorn.png'));
	//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/unicorn.png'

	console.log(await findUp(['rainbow.png', 'unicorn.png']));
	//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/unicorn.png'

	console.log(await findUp(async directory => {
		const hasUnicorns = await findUp.exists(path.join(directory, 'unicorn.png'));
		return hasUnicorns && directory;
	}, {type: 'directory'}));
	//=> '/Users/sindresorhus'
})();
```


## API

### findUp(name, options?)
### findUp(matcher, options?)

Returns a `Promise` for either the path or `undefined` if it couldn't be found.

### findUp([...name], options?)

Returns a `Promise` for either the first path found (by respecting the order of the array) or `undefined` if none could be found.

### findUp.sync(name, options?)
### findUp.sync(matcher, options?)

Returns a path or `undefined` if it couldn't be found.

### findUp.sync([...name], options?)

Returns the first path found (by respecting the order of the array) or `undefined` if none could be found.

#### name

Type: `string`

Name of the file or directory to find.

#### matcher

Type: `Function`

A function that will be called with each directory until it returns a `string` with the path, which stops the search, or the root directory has been reached and nothing was found. Useful if you want to match files with certain patterns, set of permissions, or other advanced use-cases.

When using async mode, the `matcher` may optionally be an async or promise-returning function that returns the path.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### cwd

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `process.cwd()`

Directory to start from.

##### type

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `'file'`<br>
Values: `'file'` `'directory'`

The type of paths that can match.

##### allowSymlinks

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

Allow symbolic links to match if they point to the chosen path type.

### findUp.exists(path)

Returns a `Promise<boolean>` of whether the path exists.

### findUp.sync.exists(path)

Returns a `boolean` of whether the path exists.

#### path

Type: `string`

Path to a file or directory.

### findUp.stop

A [`Symbol`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) that can be returned by a `matcher` function to stop the search and cause `findUp` to immediately return `undefined`. Useful as a performance optimization in case the current working directory is deeply nested in the filesystem.

```js
const path = require('path');
const findUp = require('find-up');

(async () => {
	await findUp(directory => {
		return path.basename(directory) === 'work' ? findUp.stop : 'logo.png';
	});
})();
```

5.0.0 / 2017-12-11
------------------

Significant refactor of `copy()` & `copySync()`, including breaking changes. No changes to other functions in this release.

Huge thanks to **[@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou)** for doing most of the work on this release.

- The `filter` option can no longer be a RegExp (must be a function). This was deprecated since fs-extra v1.0.0. [#512](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/512)
- `copy()`'s `filter` option can now be a function that returns a Promise. [#518](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/518)
- `copy()` & `copySync()` now use `fs.copyFile()`/`fs.copyFileSync()` in environments that support it (currently Node 8.5.0+). Older Node versions still get the old implementation. [#505](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/505)
- Don't allow copying a directory into itself. [#83](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/83)
- Handle copying between identical files. [#198](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/198)
- Error out when copying an empty folder to a path that already exists. [#464](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/464)
- Don't create `dest`'s parent if the `filter` function aborts the `copy()` operation. [#517](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/517)
- Fix `writeStream` not being closed if there was an error in `copy()`. [#516](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/516)

4.0.3 / 2017-12-05
------------------

- Fix wrong `chmod` values in `fs.remove()` [#501](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/501)
- Fix `TypeError` on systems that don't have some `fs` operations like `lchown` [#520](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/520)

4.0.2 / 2017-09-12
------------------

- Added `EOL` option to `writeJson*` & `outputJson*` (via upgrade to jsonfile v4)
- Added promise support to [`fs.copyFile()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_copyfile_src_dest_flags_callback) in Node 8.5+
- Added `.js` extension to `main` field in `package.json` for better tooling compatibility. [#485](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/485)

4.0.1 / 2017-07-31
------------------

### Fixed

- Previously, `ensureFile()` & `ensureFileSync()` would do nothing if the path was a directory. Now, they error out for consistency with `ensureDir()`. [#465](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/465), [#466](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/466), [#470](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/470)

4.0.0 / 2017-07-14
------------------

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** The promisified versions of `fs.read()` & `fs.write()` now return objects. See [the docs](docs/fs-read-write.md) for details. [#436](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/436), [#449](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/449)
- `fs.move()` now errors out when destination is a subdirectory of source. [#458](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/458)
- Applied upstream fixes from `rimraf` to `fs.remove()` & `fs.removeSync()`. [#459](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/459)

### Fixed

- Got `fs.outputJSONSync()` working again; it was broken due to refactoring. [#428](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/428)

Also clarified the docs in a few places.

3.0.1 / 2017-05-04
------------------

- Fix bug in `move()` & `moveSync()` when source and destination are the same, and source does not exist. [#415](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/415)

3.0.0 / 2017-04-27
------------------

### Added

- **BREAKING:** Added Promise support. All asynchronous native fs methods and fs-extra methods now return a promise if the callback is not passed. [#403](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/403)
- `pathExists()`, a replacement for the deprecated `fs.exists`. `pathExists` has a normal error-first callback signature. Also added `pathExistsSync`, an alias to `fs.existsSync`, for completeness. [#406](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/406)

### Removed

- **BREAKING:** Removed support for setting the default spaces for `writeJson()`, `writeJsonSync()`, `outputJson()`, & `outputJsonSync()`. This was undocumented. [#402](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402)

### Changed

- Upgraded jsonfile dependency to v3.0.0:
  - **BREAKING:** Changed behavior of `throws` option for `readJsonSync()`; now does not throw filesystem errors when `throws` is `false`.
- **BREAKING:** `writeJson()`, `writeJsonSync()`, `outputJson()`, & `outputJsonSync()` now output minified JSON by default for consistency with `JSON.stringify()`; set the `spaces` option to `2` to override this new behavior. [#402](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402)
- Use `Buffer.allocUnsafe()` instead of `new Buffer()` in environments that support it. [#394](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/394)

### Fixed

- `removeSync()` silently failed on Windows in some cases. Now throws an `EBUSY` error. [#408](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/408)

2.1.2 / 2017-03-16
------------------

### Fixed

- Weird windows bug that resulted in `ensureDir()`'s callback being called twice in some cases. This bug may have also affected `remove()`. See [#392](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/392), [#393](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/393)

2.1.1 / 2017-03-15
------------------

### Fixed

- Reverted [`5597bd`](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/commit/5597bd5b67f7d060f5f5bf26e9635be48330f5d7), this broke compatibility with Node.js versions v4+ but less than `v4.5.0`.
- Remove `Buffer.alloc()` usage in `moveSync()`.

2.1.0 / 2017-03-15
------------------

Thanks to [Mani Maghsoudlou (@manidlou)](https://github.com/manidlou) & [Jan Peer Stöcklmair (@JPeer264)](https://github.com/JPeer264) for their extraordinary help with this release!

### Added
- `moveSync()` See [#309], [#381](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/381). ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))
- `copy()` and `copySync()`'s `filter` option now gets the destination path passed as the second parameter. [#366](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/366) ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))

### Changed
- Use `Buffer.alloc()` instead of deprecated `new Buffer()` in `copySync()`. [#380](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/380) ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))
- Refactored entire codebase to use ES6 features supported by Node.js v4+ [#355](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/355). [(@JPeer264)](https://github.com/JPeer264)
- Refactored docs. ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))

### Fixed

- `move()` shouldn't error out when source and dest are the same. [#377](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/377), [#378](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/378) ([@jdalton](https://github.com/jdalton))

2.0.0 / 2017-01-16
------------------

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Removed support for Node `v0.12`. The Node foundation stopped officially supporting it
on Jan 1st, 2017.
- **BREAKING:** Remove `walk()` and `walkSync()`. `walkSync()` was only part of `fs-extra` for a little
over two months. Use [klaw](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw) instead of `walk()`, in fact, `walk()` was just
an alias to klaw. For `walkSync()` use [klaw-sync](https://github.com/mawni/node-klaw-sync). See: [#338], [#339]

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Renamed `clobber` to `overwrite`. This affects `copy()`, `copySync()`, and `move()`. [#330], [#333]
- Moved docs, to `docs/`. [#340]

### Fixed
- Apply filters to directories in `copySync()` like in `copy()`. [#324]
- A specific condition when disk is under heavy use, `copy()` can fail. [#326]


1.0.0 / 2016-11-01
------------------

After five years of development, we finally have reach the 1.0.0 milestone! Big thanks goes
to [Ryan Zim](https://github.com/RyanZim) for leading the charge on this release!

### Added
- `walkSync()`

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: dropped Node v0.10 support.
- disabled `rimaf` globbing, wasn't used. [#280]
- deprecate `copy()/copySync()` option `filter` if it's a `RegExp`. `filter` should now be a function.
- inline `rimraf`. This is temporary and was done because `rimraf` depended upon the beefy `glob` which `fs-extra` does not use. [#300]

### Fixed
- bug fix proper closing of file handle on `utimesMillis()` [#271]
- proper escaping of files with dollar signs [#291]
- `copySync()` failed if user didn't own file. [#199], [#301]


0.30.0 / 2016-04-28
-------------------
- Brought back Node v0.10 support. I didn't realize there was still demand. Official support will end **2016-10-01**.

0.29.0 / 2016-04-27
-------------------
- **BREAKING**: removed support for Node v0.10. If you still want to use Node v0.10, everything should work except for `ensureLink()/ensureSymlink()`. Node v0.12 is still supported but will be dropped in the near future as well.

0.28.0 / 2016-04-17
-------------------
- **BREAKING**: removed `createOutputStream()`. Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-output-stream. See: [#192][#192]
- `mkdirs()/mkdirsSync()` check for invalid win32 path chars. See: [#209][#209], [#237][#237]
- `mkdirs()/mkdirsSync()` if drive not mounted, error. See: [#93][#93]

0.27.0 / 2016-04-15
-------------------
- add `dereference` option to `copySync()`. [#235][#235]

0.26.7 / 2016-03-16
-------------------
- fixed `copy()` if source and dest are the same. [#230][#230]

0.26.6 / 2016-03-15
-------------------
- fixed if `emptyDir()` does not have a callback: [#229][#229]

0.26.5 / 2016-01-27
-------------------
- `copy()` with two arguments (w/o callback) was broken. See: [#215][#215]

0.26.4 / 2016-01-05
-------------------
- `copySync()` made `preserveTimestamps` default consistent with `copy()` which is `false`. See: [#208][#208]

0.26.3 / 2015-12-17
-------------------
- fixed `copy()` hangup in copying blockDevice / characterDevice / `/dev/null`. See: [#193][#193]

0.26.2 / 2015-11-02
-------------------
- fixed `outputJson{Sync}()` spacing adherence to `fs.spaces`

0.26.1 / 2015-11-02
-------------------
- fixed `copySync()` when `clogger=true` and the destination is read only. See: [#190][#190]

0.26.0 / 2015-10-25
-------------------
- extracted the `walk()` function into its own module [`klaw`](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw).

0.25.0 / 2015-10-24
-------------------
- now has a file walker `walk()`

0.24.0 / 2015-08-28
-------------------
- removed alias `delete()` and `deleteSync()`. See: [#171][#171]

0.23.1 / 2015-08-07
-------------------
- Better handling of errors for `move()` when moving across devices. [#170][#170]
- `ensureSymlink()` and `ensureLink()` should not throw errors if link exists. [#169][#169]

0.23.0 / 2015-08-06
-------------------
- added `ensureLink{Sync}()` and `ensureSymlink{Sync}()`. See: [#165][#165]

0.22.1 / 2015-07-09
-------------------
- Prevent calling `hasMillisResSync()` on module load. See: [#149][#149].
Fixes regression that was introduced in `0.21.0`.

0.22.0 / 2015-07-09
-------------------
- preserve permissions / ownership in `copy()`. See: [#54][#54]

0.21.0 / 2015-07-04
-------------------
- add option to preserve timestamps in `copy()` and `copySync()`. See: [#141][#141]
- updated `graceful-fs@3.x` to `4.x`. This brings in features from `amazing-graceful-fs` (much cleaner code / less hacks)

0.20.1 / 2015-06-23
-------------------
- fixed regression caused by latest jsonfile update: See: https://github.com/jprichardson/node-jsonfile/issues/26

0.20.0 / 2015-06-19
-------------------
- removed `jsonfile` aliases with `File` in the name, they weren't documented and probably weren't in use e.g.
this package had both `fs.readJsonFile` and `fs.readJson` that were aliases to each other, now use `fs.readJson`.
- preliminary walker created. Intentionally not documented. If you use it, it will almost certainly change and break your code.

Node.js: fs-extra
=================

`fs-extra` adds file system methods that aren't included in the native `fs` module and adds promise support to the `fs` methods. It also uses [`graceful-fs`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-graceful-fs) to prevent `EMFILE` errors. It should be a drop in replacement for `fs`.

Why?
----

I got tired of including `mkdirp`, `rimraf`, and `ncp` in most of my projects.




Installation
------------

    npm install fs-extra



Usage
-----

`fs-extra` is a drop in replacement for native `fs`. All methods in `fs` are attached to `fs-extra`. All `fs` methods return promises if the callback isn't passed.

You don't ever need to include the original `fs` module again:

```js
const fs = require('fs') // this is no longer necessary
```

you can now do this:

```js
const fs = require('fs-extra')
```

or if you prefer to make it clear that you're using `fs-extra` and not `fs`, you may want
to name your `fs` variable `fse` like so:

```js
const fse = require('fs-extra')
```

you can also keep both, but it's redundant:

```js
const fs = require('fs')
const fse = require('fs-extra')
```

Sync vs Async vs Async/Await
-------------
Most methods are async by default. All async methods will return a promise if the callback isn't passed.

Sync methods on the other hand will throw if an error occurs.

Also Async/Await will throw an error if one occurs.

Example:

```js
const fs = require('fs-extra')

// Async with promises:
fs.copy('/tmp/myfile', '/tmp/mynewfile')
  .then(() => console.log('success!'))
  .catch(err => console.error(err))

// Async with callbacks:
fs.copy('/tmp/myfile', '/tmp/mynewfile', err => {
  if (err) return console.error(err)
  console.log('success!')
})

// Sync:
try {
  fs.copySync('/tmp/myfile', '/tmp/mynewfile')
  console.log('success!')
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err)
}

// Async/Await:
async function copyFiles () {
  try {
    await fs.copy('/tmp/myfile', '/tmp/mynewfile')
    console.log('success!')
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err)
  }
}

copyFiles()
```


Methods
-------

### Async

- [copy](docs/copy.md)
- [emptyDir](docs/emptyDir.md)
- [ensureFile](docs/ensureFile.md)
- [ensureDir](docs/ensureDir.md)
- [ensureLink](docs/ensureLink.md)
- [ensureSymlink](docs/ensureSymlink.md)
- [mkdirp](docs/ensureDir.md)
- [mkdirs](docs/ensureDir.md)
- [move](docs/move.md)
- [outputFile](docs/outputFile.md)
- [outputJson](docs/outputJson.md)
- [pathExists](docs/pathExists.md)
- [readJson](docs/readJson.md)
- [remove](docs/remove.md)
- [writeJson](docs/writeJson.md)

### Sync

- [copySync](docs/copy-sync.md)
- [emptyDirSync](docs/emptyDir-sync.md)
- [ensureFileSync](docs/ensureFile-sync.md)
- [ensureDirSync](docs/ensureDir-sync.md)
- [ensureLinkSync](docs/ensureLink-sync.md)

- [readJsonSync](docs/readJson-sync.md)
- [removeSync](docs/remove-sync.md)
- [writeJsonSync](docs/writeJson-sync.md)


**NOTE:** You can still use the native Node.js methods. They are promisified and copied over to `fs-extra`. See [notes on `fs.read()`, `fs.write()`, & `fs.writev()`](docs/fs-read-write-writev.md)

### What happened to `walk()` and `walkSync()`?

They were removed from `fs-extra` in v2.0.0. If you need the functionality, `walk` and `walkSync` are available as separate packages, [`klaw`](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw) and [`klaw-sync`](https://github.com/manidlou/node-klaw-sync).


Third Party
-----------

### CLI

[fse-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atao60/fse-cli) allows you to run `fs-extra` from a console or from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) scripts.

### TypeScript

If you like TypeScript, you can use `fs-extra` with it: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/fs-extra


### File / Directory Watching

If you want to watch for changes to files or directories, then you should use [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar).

### Obtain Filesystem (Devices, Partitions) Information

[fs-filesystem](https://github.com/arthurintelligence/node-fs-filesystem) allows you to read the state of the filesystem of the host on which it is run. It returns information about both the devices and the partitions (volumes) of the system.

### Misc.

- [fs-extra-debug](https://github.com/jdxcode/fs-extra-debug) - Send your fs-extra calls to [debug](https://npmjs.org/package/debug).
- [mfs](https://github.com/cadorn/mfs) - Monitor your fs-extra calls.



Hacking on fs-extra
-------------------

Wanna hack on `fs-extra`? Great! Your help is needed! [fs-extra is one of the most depended upon Node.js packages](http://nodei.co/npm/fs-extra.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true). This project
uses [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/feross/standard) - if the name or style choices bother you,
you're gonna have to get over it :) If `standard` is good enough for `npm`, it's good enough for `fs-extra`.

[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

What's needed?
- First, take a look at existing issues. Those are probably going to be where the priority lies.
- More tests for edge cases. Specifically on different platforms. There can never be enough tests.
- Improve test coverage. See coveralls output for more info.

Note: If you make any big changes, **you should definitely file an issue for discussion first.**

### Running the Test Suite

fs-extra contains hundreds of tests.

- `npm run lint`: runs the linter ([standard](http://standardjs.com/))
- `npm run unit`: runs the unit tests
- `npm test`: runs both the linter and the tests


### Windows

If you run the tests on the Windows and receive a lot of symbolic link `EPERM` permission errors, it's
because on Windows you need elevated privilege to create symbolic links. You can add this to your Windows's
account by following the instructions here: http://superuser.com/questions/104845/permission-to-make-symbolic-links-in-windows-7
However, I didn't have much luck doing this.

Since I develop on Mac OS X, I use VMWare Fusion for Windows testing. I create a shared folder that I map to a drive on Windows.
I open the `Node.js command prompt` and run as `Administrator`. I then map the network drive running the following command:

    net use z: "\\vmware-host\Shared Folders"

I can then navigate to my `fs-extra` directory and run the tests.


Naming
------

I put a lot of thought into the naming of these functions. Inspired by @coolaj86's request. So he deserves much of the credit for raising the issue. See discussion(s) here:

* https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/2
* https://github.com/flatiron/utile/issues/11
* https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/wrench-js/issues/29
* https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/issues/17

First, I believe that in as many cases as possible, the [Node.js naming schemes](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) should be chosen. However, there are problems with the Node.js own naming schemes.

For example, `fs.readFile()` and `fs.readdir()`: the **F** is capitalized in *File* and the **d** is not capitalized in *dir*. Perhaps a bit pedantic, but they should still be consistent. Also, Node.js has chosen a lot of POSIX naming schemes, which I believe is great. See: `fs.mkdir()`, `fs.rmdir()`, `fs.chown()`, etc.

We have a dilemma though. How do you consistently name methods that perform the following POSIX commands: `cp`, `cp -r`, `mkdir -p`, and `rm -rf`?

My perspective: when in doubt, err on the side of simplicity. A directory is just a hierarchical grouping of directories and files. Consider that for a moment. So when you want to copy it or remove it, in most cases you'll want to copy or remove all of its contents. When you want to create a directory, if the directory that it's suppose to be contained in does not exist, then in most cases you'll want to create that too.

So, if you want to remove a file or a directory regardless of whether it has contents, just call `fs.remove(path)`. If you want to copy a file or a directory whether it has contents, just call `fs.copy(source, destination)`. If you want to create a directory regardless of whether its parent directories exist, just call `fs.mkdirs(path)` or `fs.mkdirp(path)`.

# fs.realpath

A backwards-compatible fs.realpath for Node v6 and above

In Node v6, the JavaScript implementation of fs.realpath was replaced
with a faster (but less resilient) native implementation.  That raises
new and platform-specific errors and cannot handle long or excessively
symlink-looping paths.

This module handles those cases by detecting the new errors and
falling back to the JavaScript implementation.  On versions of Node
prior to v6, it has no effect.

## USAGE

```js
var rp = require('fs.realpath')

// async version
rp.realpath(someLongAndLoopingPath, function (er, real) {
  // the ELOOP was handled, but it was a bit slower
})

// sync version
var real = rp.realpathSync(someLongAndLoopingPath)

// monkeypatch at your own risk!
// This replaces the fs.realpath/fs.realpathSync builtins
rp.monkeypatch()

// un-do the monkeypatching
rp.unmonkeypatch()
```

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ol2q94g1932cy14a/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/embercli/get-caller-file/branch/master)

This is a utility, which allows a function to figure out from which file it was invoked. It does so by inspecting v8's stack trace at the time it is invoked.

Inspired by http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13227489

*note: this relies on Node/V8 specific APIs, as such other runtimes may not work*

## Installation

```bash
yarn add get-caller-file
```

## Usage

Given:

```js
// ./foo.js
const getCallerFile = require('get-caller-file');

module.exports = function() {
  return getCallerFile(); // figures out who called it
};
```

```js
// index.js
const foo = require('./foo');

foo() // => /full/path/to/this/file/index.js
```


## Options:

* `getCallerFile(position = 2)`: where position is stack frame whos fileName we want.

## API

The methods returns a promise that resolves when the `end` event fires on the stream, indicating that there is no more data to be read. The stream is switched to flowing mode.

### getStream(stream, [options])

Get the `stream` as a string.

#### options

Type: `Object`

##### encoding

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `utf8`

[Encoding](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer) of the incoming stream.

##### maxBuffer

Type: `number`<br>
Default: `Infinity`

Maximum length of the returned string. If it exceeds this value before the stream ends, the promise will be rejected with a `getStream.MaxBufferError` error.

### getStream.buffer(stream, [options])

Get the `stream` as a buffer.

It honors the `maxBuffer` option as above, but it refers to byte length rather than string length.

### getStream.array(stream, [options])

Get the `stream` as an array of values.

It honors both the `maxBuffer` and `encoding` options. The behavior changes slightly based on the encoding chosen:

- When `encoding` is unset, it assumes an [object mode stream](https://nodesource.com/blog/understanding-object-streams/) and collects values emitted from `stream` unmodified. In this case `maxBuffer` refers to the number of items in the array (not the sum of their sizes).

- When `encoding` is set to `buffer`, it collects an array of buffers. `maxBuffer` refers to the summed byte lengths of every buffer in the array.

- When `encoding` is set to anything else, it collects an array of strings. `maxBuffer` refers to the summed character lengths of every string in the array.


## Errors

If the input stream emits an `error` event, the promise will be rejected with the error. The buffered data will be attached to the `bufferedData` property of the error.

```js
(async () => {
	try {
		await getStream(streamThatErrorsAtTheEnd('unicorn'));
	} catch (error) {
		console.log(error.bufferedData);
		//=> 'unicorn'
	}
})()

### How is this different from [`concat-stream`](https://github.com/maxogden/concat-stream)?

This module accepts a stream instead of being one and returns a promise instead of using a callback. The API is simpler and it only supports returning a string, buffer, or array. It doesn't have a fragile type inference. You explicitly choose what you want. And it doesn't depend on the huge `readable-stream` package.

# glob-parent

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Downloads][downloads-image]][npm-url] [![Azure Pipelines Build Status][azure-pipelines-image]][azure-pipelines-url] [![Travis Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![AppVeyor Build Status][appveyor-image]][appveyor-url] [![Coveralls Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url] [![Gitter chat][gitter-image]][gitter-url]

Extract the non-magic parent path from a glob string.

## Usage

```js
var globParent = require('glob-parent');

globParent('path/to/*.js'); // 'path/to'
globParent('/root/path/to/*.js'); // '/root/path/to'
globParent('/*.js'); // '/'
globParent('*.js'); // '.'
globParent('**/*.js'); // '.'
globParent('path/{to,from}'); // 'path'
globParent('path/!(to|from)'); // 'path'
globParent('path/?(to|from)'); // 'path'
globParent('path/+(to|from)'); // 'path'
globParent('path/*(to|from)'); // 'path'
globParent('path/@(to|from)'); // 'path'
globParent('path/**/*'); // 'path'

// if provided a non-glob path, returns the nearest dir
globParent('path/foo/bar.js'); // 'path/foo'
globParent('path/foo/'); // 'path/foo'
globParent('path/foo'); // 'path' (see issue #3 for details)
```

## API

### `globParent(maybeGlobString, [options])`

Takes a string and returns the part of the path before the glob begins. Be aware of Escaping rules and Limitations below.

#### options

```js
{
  // Disables the automatic conversion of slashes for Windows
  flipBackslashes: true
}
```

## Escaping

The following characters have special significance in glob patterns and must be escaped if you want them to be treated as regular path characters:

- `?` (question mark) unless used as a path segment alone
- `*` (asterisk)
- `|` (pipe)
- `(` (opening parenthesis)
- `)` (closing parenthesis)
- `{` (opening curly brace)
- `}` (closing curly brace)
- `[` (opening bracket)
- `]` (closing bracket)

**Example**

```js
globParent('foo/[bar]/') // 'foo'
globParent('foo/\\[bar]/') // 'foo/[bar]'
```

## Limitations

### Braces & Brackets
This library attempts a quick and imperfect method of determining which path
parts have glob magic without fully parsing/lexing the pattern. There are some
advanced use cases that can trip it up, such as nested braces where the outer
pair is escaped and the inner one contains a path separator. If you find
yourself in the unlikely circumstance of being affected by this or need to
ensure higher-fidelity glob handling in your library, it is recommended that you
pre-process your input with [expand-braces] and/or [expand-brackets].

### Windows
Backslashes are not valid path separators for globs. If a path with backslashes
is provided anyway, for simple cases, glob-parent will replace the path
separator for you and return the non-glob parent path (now with
forward-slashes, which are still valid as Windows path separators).

This cannot be used in conjunction with escape characters.

```js
// BAD
globParent('C:\\Program Files \\(x86\\)\\*.ext') // 'C:/Program Files /(x86/)'

// GOOD
globParent('C:/Program Files\\(x86\\)/*.ext') // 'C:/Program Files (x86)'
```

If you are using escape characters for a pattern without path parts (i.e.
relative to `cwd`), prefix with `./` to avoid confusing glob-parent.

```js
// BAD
globParent('foo \\[bar]') // 'foo '
globParent('foo \\[bar]*') // 'foo '

// GOOD
globParent('./foo \\[bar]') // 'foo [bar]'
globParent('./foo \\[bar]*') // '.'
```

# Glob

Match files using the patterns the shell uses, like stars and stuff.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/isaacs/node-glob.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/isaacs/node-glob/) [![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/kd7f3yftf7unxlsx?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/isaacs/node-glob) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/isaacs/node-glob/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/isaacs/node-glob?branch=master)

This is a glob implementation in JavaScript.  It uses the `minimatch`
library to do its matching.

![](logo/glob.png)

## Usage

Install with npm

```
npm i glob
```

```javascript
var glob = require("glob")

// options is optional
glob("**/*.js", options, function (er, files) {
  // files is an array of filenames.
  // If the `nonull` option is set, and nothing
  // was found, then files is ["**/*.js"]
  // er is an error object or null.
})
```

## Glob Primer

"Globs" are the patterns you type when you do stuff like `ls *.js` on
the command line, or put `build/*` in a `.gitignore` file.

Before parsing the path part patterns, braced sections are expanded
into a set.  Braced sections start with `{` and end with `}`, with any
number of comma-delimited sections within.  Braced sections may contain
slash characters, so `a{/b/c,bcd}` would expand into `a/b/c` and `abcd`.

The following characters have special magic meaning when used in a
path portion:

* `*` Matches 0 or more characters in a single path portion
* `?` Matches 1 character
* `[...]` Matches a range of characters, similar to a RegExp range.
  If the first character of the range is `!` or `^` then it matches
  any character not in the range.
* `!(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches anything that does not match
  any of the patterns provided.
* `?(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches zero or one occurrence of the
  patterns provided.
* `+(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches one or more occurrences of the
  patterns provided.
* `*(a|b|c)` Matches zero or more occurrences of the patterns provided
* `@(pattern|pat*|pat?erN)` Matches exactly one of the patterns
  provided
* `**` If a "globstar" is alone in a path portion, then it matches
  zero or more directories and subdirectories searching for matches.
  It does not crawl symlinked directories.

### Dots

If a file or directory path portion has a `.` as the first character,
then it will not match any glob pattern unless that pattern's
corresponding path part also has a `.` as its first character.

For example, the pattern `a/.*/c` would match the file at `a/.b/c`.
However the pattern `a/*/c` would not, because `*` does not start with
a dot character.

You can make glob treat dots as normal characters by setting
`dot:true` in the options.

### Basename Matching

If you set `matchBase:true` in the options, and the pattern has no
slashes in it, then it will seek for any file anywhere in the tree
with a matching basename.  For example, `*.js` would match
`test/simple/basic.js`.

### Empty Sets

If no matching files are found, then an empty array is returned.  This
differs from the shell, where the pattern itself is returned.  For
example:

    $ echo a*s*d*f
    a*s*d*f

To get the bash-style behavior, set the `nonull:true` in the options.

### See Also:

* `man sh`
* `man bash` (Search for "Pattern Matching")
* `man 3 fnmatch`
* `man 5 gitignore`
* [minimatch documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)

## glob.hasMagic(pattern, [options])

Returns `true` if there are any special characters in the pattern, and
`false` otherwise.

Note that the options affect the results.  If `noext:true` is set in
the options object, then `+(a|b)` will not be considered a magic
pattern.  If the pattern has a brace expansion, like `a/{b/c,x/y}`
then that is considered magical, unless `nobrace:true` is set in the
options.

## glob(pattern, [options], cb)

* `pattern` `{String}` Pattern to be matched
* `options` `{Object}`
* `cb` `{Function}`
  * `err` `{Error | null}`
  * `matches` `{Array<String>}` filenames found matching the pattern

Perform an asynchronous glob search.

## glob.sync(pattern, [options])

* `pattern` `{String}` Pattern to be matched
* `options` `{Object}`
* return: `{Array<String>}` filenames found matching the pattern

Perform a synchronous glob search.

## Class: glob.Glob

Create a Glob object by instantiating the `glob.Glob` class.

```javascript
var Glob = require("glob").Glob
var mg = new Glob(pattern, options, cb)
```

It's an EventEmitter, and starts walking the filesystem to find matches
immediately.

### new glob.Glob(pattern, [options], [cb])

* `pattern` `{String}` pattern to search for
* `options` `{Object}`
* `cb` `{Function}` Called when an error occurs, or matches are found
  * `err` `{Error | null}`
  * `matches` `{Array<String>}` filenames found matching the pattern

Note that if the `sync` flag is set in the options, then matches will
be immediately available on the `g.found` member.

### Properties

* `minimatch` The minimatch object that the glob uses.
* `options` The options object passed in.
* `aborted` Boolean which is set to true when calling `abort()`.  There
  is no way at this time to continue a glob search after aborting, but
  you can re-use the statCache to avoid having to duplicate syscalls.
* `cache` Convenience object.  Each field has the following possible
  values:
  * `false` - Path does not exist
  * `true` - Path exists
  * `'FILE'` - Path exists, and is not a directory
  * `'DIR'` - Path exists, and is a directory
  * `[file, entries, ...]` - Path exists, is a directory, and the
    array value is the results of `fs.readdir`
* `statCache` Cache of `fs.stat` results, to prevent statting the same
  path multiple times.
* `symlinks` A record of which paths are symbolic links, which is
  relevant in resolving `**` patterns.
* `realpathCache` An optional object which is passed to `fs.realpath`
  to minimize unnecessary syscalls.  It is stored on the instantiated
  Glob object, and may be re-used.

### Events

* `end` When the matching is finished, this is emitted with all the
  matches found.  If the `nonull` option is set, and no match was found,
  then the `matches` list contains the original pattern.  The matches
  are sorted, unless the `nosort` flag is set.
* `match` Every time a match is found, this is emitted with the specific
  thing that matched. It is not deduplicated or resolved to a realpath.
* `error` Emitted when an unexpected error is encountered, or whenever
  any fs error occurs if `options.strict` is set.
* `abort` When `abort()` is called, this event is raised.

### Methods

* `pause` Temporarily stop the search
* `resume` Resume the search
* `abort` Stop the search forever

### Options

All the options that can be passed to Minimatch can also be passed to
Glob to change pattern matching behavior.  Also, some have been added,
or have glob-specific ramifications.

All options are false by default, unless otherwise noted.

All options are added to the Glob object, as well.

If you are running many `glob` operations, you can pass a Glob object
as the `options` argument to a subsequent operation to shortcut some
`stat` and `readdir` calls.  At the very least, you may pass in shared
`symlinks`, `statCache`, `realpathCache`, and `cache` options, so that
parallel glob operations will be sped up by sharing information about
the filesystem.

* `cwd` The current working directory in which to search.  Defaults
  to `process.cwd()`.
* `root` The place where patterns starting with `/` will be mounted
  onto.  Defaults to `path.resolve(options.cwd, "/")` (`/` on Unix
  systems, and `C:\` or some such on Windows.)
* `dot` Include `.dot` files in normal matches and `globstar` matches.
  Note that an explicit dot in a portion of the pattern will always
  match dot files.
* `nomount` By default, a pattern starting with a forward-slash will be
  "mounted" onto the root setting, so that a valid filesystem path is
  returned.  Set this flag to disable that behavior.
* `mark` Add a `/` character to directory matches.  Note that this
  requires additional stat calls.
* `nosort` Don't sort the results.
* `stat` Set to true to stat *all* results.  This reduces performance
  somewhat, and is completely unnecessary, unless `readdir` is presumed
  to be an untrustworthy indicator of file existence.
* `silent` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to
  read a directory, a warning will be printed to stderr.  Set the
  `silent` option to true to suppress these warnings.
* `strict` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to
  read a directory, the process will just continue on in search of
  other matches.  Set the `strict` option to raise an error in these
  cases.
* `cache` See `cache` property above.  Pass in a previously generated
  cache object to save some fs calls.
* `statCache` A cache of results of filesystem information, to prevent
  unnecessary stat calls.  While it should not normally be necessary
  to set this, you may pass the statCache from one glob() call to the
  options object of another, if you know that the filesystem will not
  change between calls.  (See "Race Conditions" below.)
* `symlinks` A cache of known symbolic links.  You may pass in a
  previously generated `symlinks` object to save `lstat` calls when
  resolving `**` matches.
* `sync` DEPRECATED: use `glob.sync(pattern, opts)` instead.
* `nounique` In some cases, brace-expanded patterns can result in the
  same file showing up multiple times in the result set.  By default,
  this implementation prevents duplicates in the result set.  Set this
  flag to disable that behavior.
* `nonull` Set to never return an empty set, instead returning a set
  containing the pattern itself.  This is the default in glob(3).
* `debug` Set to enable debug logging in minimatch and glob.
* `nobrace` Do not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.
* `noglobstar` Do not match `**` against multiple filenames.  (Ie,
  treat it as a normal `*` instead.)
* `noext` Do not match `+(a|b)` "extglob" patterns.
* `nocase` Perform a case-insensitive match.  Note: on
  case-insensitive filesystems, non-magic patterns will match by
  default, since `stat` and `readdir` will not raise errors.
* `matchBase` Perform a basename-only match if the pattern does not
  contain any slash characters.  That is, `*.js` would be treated as
  equivalent to `**/*.js`, matching all js files in all directories.
* `nodir` Do not match directories, only files.  (Note: to match
  *only* directories, simply put a `/` at the end of the pattern.)
* `ignore` Add a pattern or an array of glob patterns to exclude matches.
  Note: `ignore` patterns are *always* in `dot:true` mode, regardless
  of any other settings.
* `follow` Follow symlinked directories when expanding `**` patterns.
  Note that this can result in a lot of duplicate references in the
  presence of cyclic links.
* `realpath` Set to true to call `fs.realpath` on all of the results.
  In the case of a symlink that cannot be resolved, the full absolute
  path to the matched entry is returned (though it will usually be a
  broken symlink)
* `absolute` Set to true to always receive absolute paths for matched
  files.  Unlike `realpath`, this also affects the values returned in
  the `match` event.

## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations

While strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile
goal, some discrepancies exist between node-glob and other
implementations, and are intentional.

The double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless the
`noglobstar` flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob
and bash 4.3, where `**` only has special significance if it is the only
thing in a path part.  That is, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/b`, but
`a/**b` will not.

Note that symlinked directories are not crawled as part of a `**`,
though their contents may match against subsequent portions of the
pattern.  This prevents infinite loops and duplicates and the like.

If an escaped pattern has no matches, and the `nonull` flag is set,
then glob returns the pattern as-provided, rather than
interpreting the character escapes.  For example,
`glob.match([], "\\*a\\?")` will return `"\\*a\\?"` rather than
`"*a?"`.  This is akin to setting the `nullglob` option in bash, except
that it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.

If brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any
other interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like
`+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded
**first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and those patterns are
checked for validity.  Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.

### Comments and Negation

Previously, this module let you mark a pattern as a "comment" if it
started with a `#` character, or a "negated" pattern if it started
with a `!` character.

These options were deprecated in version 5, and removed in version 6.

To specify things that should not match, use the `ignore` option.

## Windows

**Please only use forward-slashes in glob expressions.**

Though windows uses either `/` or `\` as its path separator, only `/`
characters are used by this glob implementation.  You must use
forward-slashes **only** in glob expressions.  Back-slashes will always
be interpreted as escape characters, not path separators.

Results from absolute patterns such as `/foo/*` are mounted onto the
root setting using `path.join`.  On windows, this will by default result
in `/foo/*` matching `C:\foo\bar.txt`.

## Race Conditions

Glob searching, by its very nature, is susceptible to race conditions,
since it relies on directory walking and such.

As a result, it is possible that a file that exists when glob looks for
it may have been deleted or modified by the time it returns the result.

As part of its internal implementation, this program caches all stat
and readdir calls that it makes, in order to cut down on system
overhead.  However, this also makes it even more susceptible to races,
especially if the cache or statCache objects are reused between glob
calls.

Users are thus advised not to use a glob result as a guarantee of
filesystem state in the face of rapid changes.  For the vast majority
of operations, this is never a problem.

## Usage

```js
const got = require('got');

(async () => {
	try {
		const response = await got('sindresorhus.com');
		console.log(response.body);
		//=> '<!doctype html> ...'
	} catch (error) {
		console.log(error.response.body);
		//=> 'Internal server error ...'
	}
})();
```

###### Streams

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const got = require('got');

got.stream('sindresorhus.com').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('index.html'));

// For POST, PUT, and PATCH methods `got.stream` returns a `stream.Writable`
fs.createReadStream('index.html').pipe(got.stream.post('sindresorhus.com'));
```


### API

It's a `GET` request by default, but can be changed by using different methods or in the `options`.

#### got(url, [options])

Returns a Promise for a [`response` object](#response) or a [stream](#streams-1) if `options.stream` is set to true.

##### url

Type: `string` `Object`

The URL to request, as a string, a [`https.request` options object](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_request_options_callback), or a [WHATWG `URL`](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_class_url).

Properties from `options` will override properties in the parsed `url`.

If no protocol is specified, it will default to `https`.

##### options

Type: `Object`

Any of the [`https.request`](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_request_options_callback) options.

###### baseUrl

Type: `string` `Object`

When specified, `url` will be prepended by `baseUrl`.<br>
If you specify an absolute URL, it will skip the `baseUrl`.

Very useful when used with `got.extend()` to create niche-specific Got instances.

Can be a string or a [WHATWG `URL`](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_class_url).

Slash at the end of `baseUrl` and at the beginning of the `url` argument is optional:

```js
await got('hello', {baseUrl: 'https://example.com/v1'});
//=> 'https://example.com/v1/hello'

await got('/hello', {baseUrl: 'https://example.com/v1/'});
//=> 'https://example.com/v1/hello'

await got('/hello', {baseUrl: 'https://example.com/v1'});
//=> 'https://example.com/v1/hello'
```

###### headers

Type: `Object`<br>
Default: `{}`

Request headers.

Existing headers will be overwritten. Headers set to `null` will be omitted.

###### stream

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Returns a `Stream` instead of a `Promise`. This is equivalent to calling `got.stream(url, [options])`.

###### body

Type: `string` `Buffer` `stream.Readable` [`form-data` instance](https://github.com/form-data/form-data)

**Note:** If you provide this option, `got.stream()` will be read-only.

The body that will be sent with a `POST` request.

If present in `options` and `options.method` is not set, `options.method` will be set to `POST`.

The `content-length` header will be automatically set if `body` is a `string` / `Buffer` / `fs.createReadStream` instance / [`form-data` instance](https://github.com/form-data/form-data), and `content-length` and `transfer-encoding` are not manually set in `options.headers`.

###### cookieJar

Type: [`tough.CookieJar` instance](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie#cookiejar)

**Note:** If you provide this option, `options.headers.cookie` will be overridden.

Cookie support. You don't have to care about parsing or how to store them. [Example.](#cookies)

###### encoding

Type: `string` `null`<br>
Default: `'utf8'`

[Encoding](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffers_and_character_encodings) to be used on `setEncoding` of the response data. If `null`, the body is returned as a [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) (binary data).

###### form

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

**Note:** If you provide this option, `got.stream()` will be read-only.
**Note:** `body` must be a plain object. It will be converted to a query string using [`(new URLSearchParams(object)).toString()`](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_constructor_new_urlsearchparams_obj).

If set to `true` and `Content-Type` header is not set, it will be set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

###### json

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

**Note:** If you use `got.stream()`, this option will be ignored.
**Note:** `body` must be a plain object or array and will be stringified.

If set to `true` and `Content-Type` header is not set, it will be set to `application/json`.

Parse response body with `JSON.parse` and set `accept` header to `application/json`. If used in conjunction with the `form` option, the `body` will the stringified as querystring and the response parsed as JSON.

###### query

Type: `string` `Object<string, string|number>` [`URLSearchParams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams)

Query string that will be added to the request URL. This will override the query string in `url`.

If you need to pass in an array, you can do it using a `URLSearchParams` instance:

```js
const got = require('got');

const query = new URLSearchParams([['key', 'a'], ['key', 'b']]);

got('https://example.com', {query});

console.log(query.toString());
//=> 'key=a&key=b'
```

And if you need a different array format, you could use the [`query-string`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/query-string) package:

```js
const got = require('got');
const queryString = require('query-string');

const query = queryString.stringify({key: ['a', 'b']}, {arrayFormat: 'bracket'});

got('https://example.com', {query});

console.log(query);
//=> 'key[]=a&key[]=b'
```

###### timeout

Type: `number` `Object`

Milliseconds to wait for the server to end the response before aborting the request with [`got.TimeoutError`](#gottimeouterror) error (a.k.a. `request` property). By default, there's no timeout.

This also accepts an `object` with the following fields to constrain the duration of each phase of the request lifecycle:

- `lookup` starts when a socket is assigned and ends when the hostname has been resolved. Does not apply when using a Unix domain socket.
- `connect` starts when `lookup` completes (or when the socket is assigned if lookup does not apply to the request) and ends when the socket is connected.
- `secureConnect` starts when `connect` completes and ends when the handshaking process completes (HTTPS only).
- `socket` starts when the socket is connected. See [request.setTimeout](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_request_settimeout_timeout_callback).
- `response` starts when the request has been written to the socket and ends when the response headers are received.
- `send` starts when the socket is connected and ends with the request has been written to the socket.
- `request` starts when the request is initiated and ends when the response's end event fires.

###### retry

Type: `number` `Object`<br>
Default:
- retries: `2`
- methods: `GET` `PUT` `HEAD` `DELETE` `OPTIONS` `TRACE`
- statusCodes: [`408`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) [`413`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/413) [`429`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) [`500`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) [`502`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/502) [`503`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/503) [`504`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/504)
- maxRetryAfter: `undefined`
- errorCodes: `ETIMEDOUT` `ECONNRESET` `EADDRINUSE` `ECONNREFUSED` `EPIPE` `ENOTFOUND` `ENETUNREACH` `EAI_AGAIN`

An object representing `retries`, `methods`, `statusCodes`, `maxRetryAfter` and `errorCodes` fields for the time until retry, allowed methods, allowed status codes, maximum [`Retry-After`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After) time and allowed error codes.

If `maxRetryAfter` is set to `undefined`, it will use `options.timeout`.<br>
If [`Retry-After`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After) header is greater than `maxRetryAfter`, it will cancel the request.

Delays between retries counts with function `1000 * Math.pow(2, retry) + Math.random() * 100`, where `retry` is attempt number (starts from 1).

The `retries` property can be a `number` or a `function` with `retry` and `error` arguments. The function must return a delay in milliseconds (`0` return value cancels retry).

By default, it retries *only* on the specified methods, status codes, and on these network errors:
- `ETIMEDOUT`: One of the [timeout](#timeout) limits were reached.
- `ECONNRESET`: Connection was forcibly closed by a peer.
- `EADDRINUSE`: Could not bind to any free port.
- `ECONNREFUSED`: Connection was refused by the server.
- `EPIPE`: The remote side of the stream being written has been closed.
- `ENOTFOUND`: Couldn't resolve the hostname to an IP address.
- `ENETUNREACH`: No internet connection.
- `EAI_AGAIN`: DNS lookup timed out.

###### followRedirect

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

Defines if redirect responses should be followed automatically.

Note that if a `303` is sent by the server in response to any request type (`POST`, `DELETE`, etc.), Got will automatically request the resource pointed to in the location header via `GET`. This is in accordance with [the spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.4).

###### decompress

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

Decompress the response automatically. This will set the `accept-encoding` header to `gzip, deflate` unless you set it yourself.

If this is disabled, a compressed response is returned as a `Buffer`. This may be useful if you want to handle decompression yourself or stream the raw compressed data.

###### cache

Type: `Object`<br>
Default: `false`

[Cache adapter instance](#cache-adapters) for storing cached data.

###### request

Type: `Function`<br>
Default: `http.request` `https.request` *(depending on the protocol)*

Custom request function. The main purpose of this is to [support HTTP2 using a wrapper](#experimental-http2-support).

###### useElectronNet

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

When used in Electron, Got will use [`electron.net`](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/net/) instead of the Node.js `http` module. According to the Electron docs, it should be fully compatible, but it's not entirely. See [#443](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/443) and [#461](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/461).

###### throwHttpErrors

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

Determines if a `got.HTTPError` is thrown for error responses (non-2xx status codes).

If this is disabled, requests that encounter an error status code will be resolved with the `response` instead of throwing. This may be useful if you are checking for resource availability and are expecting error responses.

###### agent

Same as the [`agent` option](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_request_url_options_callback) for `http.request`, but with an extra feature:

If you require different agents for different protocols, you can pass a map of agents to the `agent` option. This is necessary because a request to one protocol might redirect to another. In such a scenario, Got will switch over to the right protocol agent for you.

```js
const got = require('got');
const HttpAgent = require('agentkeepalive');
const {HttpsAgent} = HttpAgent;

got('sindresorhus.com', {
	agent: {
		http: new HttpAgent(),
		https: new HttpsAgent()
	}
});
```

###### hooks

Type: `Object<string, Function[]>`

Hooks allow modifications during the request lifecycle. Hook functions may be async and are run serially.

###### hooks.init

Type: `Function[]`<br>
Default: `[]`

Called with plain [request options](#options), right before their normalization. This is especially useful in conjunction with [`got.extend()`](#instances) and [`got.create()`](advanced-creation.md) when the input needs custom handling.

See the [Request migration guide](migration-guides.md#breaking-changes) for an example.

**Note**: This hook must be synchronous!

###### hooks.beforeRequest

Type: `Function[]`<br>
Default: `[]`

Called with [normalized](source/normalize-arguments.js) [request options](#options). Got will make no further changes to the request before it is sent. This is especially useful in conjunction with [`got.extend()`](#instances) and [`got.create()`](advanced-creation.md) when you want to create an API client that, for example, uses HMAC-signing.

See the [AWS section](#aws) for an example.

**Note:** If you modify the `body` you will need to modify the `content-length` header too, because it has already been computed and assigned.

###### hooks.beforeRedirect

Type: `Function[]`<br>
Default: `[]`

Called with [normalized](source/normalize-arguments.js) [request options](#options). Got will make no further changes to the request. This is especially useful when you want to avoid dead sites. Example:

```js
const got = require('got');

got('example.com', {
	hooks: {
		beforeRedirect: [
			options => {
				if (options.hostname === 'deadSite') {
					options.hostname = 'fallbackSite';
				}
			}
		]
	}
});
```

###### hooks.beforeRetry

Type: `Function[]`<br>
Default: `[]`

Called with [normalized](source/normalize-arguments.js) [request options](#options), the error and the retry count. Got will make no further changes to the request. This is especially useful when some extra work is required before the next try. Example:

```js
const got = require('got');

got('example.com', {
	hooks: {
		beforeRetry: [
			(options, error, retryCount) => {
				if (error.statusCode === 413) { // Payload too large
					options.body = getNewBody();
				}
			}
		]
	}
});
```

###### hooks.afterResponse

Type: `Function[]`<br>
Default: `[]`

Called with [response object](#response) and a retry function.

Each function should return the response. This is especially useful when you want to refresh an access token. Example:

```js
const got = require('got');

const instance = got.extend({
	hooks: {
		afterResponse: [
			(response, retryWithMergedOptions) => {
				if (response.statusCode === 401) { // Unauthorized
					const updatedOptions = {
						headers: {
							token: getNewToken() // Refresh the access token
						}
					};

					// Save for further requests
					instance.defaults.options = got.mergeOptions(instance.defaults.options, updatedOptions);

					// Make a new retry
					return retryWithMergedOptions(updatedOptions);
				}

				// No changes otherwise
				return response;
			}
		]
	},
	mutableDefaults: true
});
```

###### hooks.beforeError

Type: `Function[]`<br>
Default: `[]`

Called with an `Error` instance. The error is passed to the hook right before it's thrown. This is especially useful when you want to have more detailed errors.

**Note**: Errors thrown while normalizing input options are thrown directly and not part of this hook.

```js	
const got = require('got');	

got('api.github.com/some-endpoint', {	
	hooks: {	
		onError: [	
			error => {	
				const {response} = error;	
 				if (response && response.body) {	
					error.name = 'GitHubError';	
					error.message = `${response.body.message} (${error.statusCode})`;	
				}

 				return error;	
			}	
		]	
	}	
});	
```

#### Response

The response object will typically be a [Node.js HTTP response stream](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), however, if returned from the cache it will be a [response-like object](https://github.com/lukechilds/responselike) which behaves in the same way.

##### request

Type: `Object`

**Note:** This is not a [http.ClientRequest](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_clientrequest).

- `gotOptions` - The options that were set on this request.

##### body

Type: `string` `Object` *(depending on `options.json`)*

The result of the request.

##### url

Type: `string`

The request URL or the final URL after redirects.

##### requestUrl

Type: `string`

The original request URL.

##### timings

Type: `Object`

The object contains the following properties:

- `start` - Time when the request started.
- `socket` - Time when a socket was assigned to the request.
- `lookup` - Time when the DNS lookup finished.
- `connect` - Time when the socket successfully connected.
- `upload` - Time when the request finished uploading.
- `response` - Time when the request fired the `response` event.
- `end` - Time when the response fired the `end` event.
- `error` - Time when the request fired the `error` event.
- `phases`
	- `wait` - `timings.socket - timings.start`
	- `dns` - `timings.lookup - timings.socket`
	- `tcp` - `timings.connect - timings.lookup`
	- `request` - `timings.upload - timings.connect`
	- `firstByte` - `timings.response - timings.upload`
	- `download` - `timings.end - timings.response`
	- `total` - `timings.end - timings.start` or `timings.error - timings.start`

**Note:** The time is a `number` representing the milliseconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch.

##### fromCache

Type: `boolean`

Whether the response was retrieved from the cache.

##### redirectUrls

Type: `Array`

The redirect URLs.

##### retryCount

Type: `number`

The number of times the request was retried.

#### Streams

**Note:** Progress events, redirect events and request/response events can also be used with promises.

#### got.stream(url, [options])

Sets `options.stream` to `true`.

Returns a [duplex stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_duplex) with additional events:

##### .on('request', request)

`request` event to get the request object of the request.

**Tip:** You can use `request` event to abort request:

```js
got.stream('github.com')
	.on('request', request => setTimeout(() => request.abort(), 50));
```

##### .on('response', response)

The `response` event to get the response object of the final request.

##### .on('redirect', response, nextOptions)

The `redirect` event to get the response object of a redirect. The second argument is options for the next request to the redirect location.

##### .on('uploadProgress', progress)
##### .on('downloadProgress', progress)

Progress events for uploading (sending a request) and downloading (receiving a response). The `progress` argument is an object like:

```js
{
	percent: 0.1,
	transferred: 1024,
	total: 10240
}
```

If it's not possible to retrieve the body size (can happen when streaming), `total` will be `null`.

```js
(async () => {
	const response = await got('sindresorhus.com')
		.on('downloadProgress', progress => {
			// Report download progress
		})
		.on('uploadProgress', progress => {
			// Report upload progress
		});

	console.log(response);
})();
```

##### .on('error', error, body, response)

The `error` event emitted in case of a protocol error (like `ENOTFOUND` etc.) or status error (4xx or 5xx). The second argument is the body of the server response in case of status error. The third argument is a response object.

#### got.get(url, [options])
#### got.post(url, [options])
#### got.put(url, [options])
#### got.patch(url, [options])
#### got.head(url, [options])
#### got.delete(url, [options])

Sets `options.method` to the method name and makes a request.

### Instances

#### got.extend([options])

Configure a new `got` instance with default `options`. The `options` are merged with the parent instance's `defaults.options` using [`got.mergeOptions`](#gotmergeoptionsparentoptions-newoptions). You can access the resolved options with the `.defaults` property on the instance.

```js
const client = got.extend({
	baseUrl: 'https://example.com',
	headers: {
		'x-unicorn': 'rainbow'
	}
});

client.get('/demo');

/* HTTP Request =>
 * GET /demo HTTP/1.1
 * Host: example.com
 * x-unicorn: rainbow
 */
```

```js
(async () => {
	const client = got.extend({
		baseUrl: 'httpbin.org',
		headers: {
			'x-foo': 'bar'
		}
	});
	const {headers} = (await client.get('/headers', {json: true})).body;
	//=> headers['x-foo'] === 'bar'

	const jsonClient = client.extend({
		json: true,
		headers: {
			'x-baz': 'qux'
		}
	});
	const {headers: headers2} = (await jsonClient.get('/headers')).body;
	//=> headers2['x-foo'] === 'bar'
	//=> headers2['x-baz'] === 'qux'
})();
```

**Tip:** Need more control over the behavior of Got? Check out the [`got.create()`](advanced-creation.md).

#### got.mergeOptions(parentOptions, newOptions)

Extends parent options. Avoid using [object spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#Spread_in_object_literals) as it doesn't work recursively:

```js
const a = {headers: {cat: 'meow', wolf: ['bark', 'wrrr']}};
const b = {headers: {cow: 'moo', wolf: ['auuu']}};

{...a, ...b}            // => {headers: {cow: 'moo', wolf: ['auuu']}}
got.mergeOptions(a, b)  // => {headers: {cat: 'meow', cow: 'moo', wolf: ['auuu']}}
```

Options are deeply merged to a new object. The value of each key is determined as follows:

- If the new property is set to `undefined`, it keeps the old one.
- If the parent property is an instance of `URL` and the new value is a `string` or `URL`, a new URL instance is created: [`new URL(new, parent)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL#Syntax).
- If the new property is a plain `Object`:
	- If the parent property is a plain `Object` too, both values are merged recursively into a new `Object`.
	- Otherwise, only the new value is deeply cloned.
- If the new property is an `Array`, it overwrites the old one with a deep clone of the new property.
- Otherwise, the new value is assigned to the key.

#### got.defaults

Type: `Object`

The default Got options.

## Errors

Each error contains `host`, `hostname`, `method`, `path`, `protocol`, `url` and `gotOptions` properties to make debugging easier.

In Promise mode, the `response` is attached to the error.

#### got.CacheError

When a cache method fails, for example, if the database goes down or there's a filesystem error.

#### got.RequestError

When a request fails. Contains a `code` property with error class code, like `ECONNREFUSED`.

#### got.ReadError

When reading from response stream fails.

#### got.ParseError

When `json` option is enabled, server response code is 2xx, and `JSON.parse` fails. Includes `statusCode` and `statusMessage` properties.

#### got.HTTPError

When the server response code is not 2xx. Includes `body`, `statusCode`, `statusMessage`, and `redirectUrls` properties.

#### got.MaxRedirectsError

When the server redirects you more than ten times. Includes a `statusCode`, `statusMessage`, and `redirectUrls` property which is an array of the URLs Got was redirected to before giving up.

#### got.UnsupportedProtocolError

When given an unsupported protocol.

#### got.CancelError

When the request is aborted with `.cancel()`.

#### got.TimeoutError

When the request is aborted due to a [timeout](#timeout). Includes an `event` property.

## Aborting the request

The promise returned by Got has a [`.cancel()`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-cancelable) method which when called, aborts the request.

```js
(async () => {
	const request = got(url, options);

	// …

	// In another part of the code
	if (something) {
		request.cancel();
	}

	// …

	try {
		await request;
	} catch (error) {
		if (request.isCanceled) { // Or `error instanceof got.CancelError`
			// Handle cancelation
		}

		// Handle other errors
	}
})();
```

## Cache

Got implements [RFC 7234](http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html) compliant HTTP caching which works out of the box in-memory and is easily pluggable with a wide range of storage adapters. Fresh cache entries are served directly from the cache, and stale cache entries are revalidated with `If-None-Match`/`If-Modified-Since` headers. You can read more about the underlying cache behavior in the [`cacheable-request` documentation](https://github.com/lukechilds/cacheable-request).

You can use the JavaScript `Map` type as an in-memory cache:

```js
const got = require('got');
const map = new Map();

(async () => {
		let response = await got('sindresorhus.com', {cache: map});
		console.log(response.fromCache);
		//=> false

		response = await got('sindresorhus.com', {cache: map});
		console.log(response.fromCache);
		//=> true
})();
```

Got uses [Keyv](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv) internally to support a wide range of storage adapters. For something more scalable you could use an [official Keyv storage adapter](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv#official-storage-adapters):

```
$ npm install @keyv/redis
```

```js
const got = require('got');
const KeyvRedis = require('@keyv/redis');

const redis = new KeyvRedis('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379');

got('sindresorhus.com', {cache: redis});
```

Got supports anything that follows the Map API, so it's easy to write your own storage adapter or use a third-party solution.

For example, the following are all valid storage adapters:

```js
const storageAdapter = new Map();
// Or
const storageAdapter = require('./my-storage-adapter');
// Or
const QuickLRU = require('quick-lru');
const storageAdapter = new QuickLRU({maxSize: 1000});

got('sindresorhus.com', {cache: storageAdapter});
```

View the [Keyv docs](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv) for more information on how to use storage adapters.


## Proxies

You can use the [`tunnel`](https://github.com/koichik/node-tunnel) package with the `agent` option to work with proxies:

```js
const got = require('got');
const tunnel = require('tunnel');

got('sindresorhus.com', {
	agent: tunnel.httpOverHttp({
		proxy: {
			host: 'localhost'
		}
	})
});
```

Check out [`global-tunnel`](https://github.com/np-maintain/global-tunnel) if you want to configure proxy support for all HTTP/HTTPS traffic in your app.


## Cookies

You can use the [`tough-cookie`](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie) package:

```js
const got = require('got');
const {CookieJar} = require('tough-cookie');

const cookieJar = new CookieJar();
cookieJar.setCookie('foo=bar', 'https://www.google.com');

got('google.com', {cookieJar});
```


## Form data

You can use the [`form-data`](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) package to create POST request with form data:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const got = require('got');
const FormData = require('form-data');
const form = new FormData();

form.append('my_file', fs.createReadStream('/foo/bar.jpg'));

got.post('google.com', {
	body: form
});
```


## OAuth

You can use the [`oauth-1.0a`](https://github.com/ddo/oauth-1.0a) package to create a signed OAuth request:

```js
const got = require('got');
const crypto  = require('crypto');
const OAuth = require('oauth-1.0a');

const oauth = OAuth({
	consumer: {
		key: process.env.CONSUMER_KEY,
		secret: process.env.CONSUMER_SECRET
	},
	signature_method: 'HMAC-SHA1',
	hash_function: (baseString, key) => crypto.createHmac('sha1', key).update(baseString).digest('base64')
});

const token = {
	key: process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN,
	secret: process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
};

const url = 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/home_timeline.json';

got(url, {
	headers: oauth.toHeader(oauth.authorize({url, method: 'GET'}, token)),
	json: true
});
```


## Unix Domain Sockets

Requests can also be sent via [unix domain sockets](http://serverfault.com/questions/124517/whats-the-difference-between-unix-socket-and-tcp-ip-socket). Use the following URL scheme: `PROTOCOL://unix:SOCKET:PATH`.

- `PROTOCOL` - `http` or `https` *(optional)*
- `SOCKET` - Absolute path to a unix domain socket, for example: `/var/run/docker.sock`
- `PATH` - Request path, for example: `/v2/keys`

```js
got('http://unix:/var/run/docker.sock:/containers/json');

// Or without protocol (HTTP by default)
got('unix:/var/run/docker.sock:/containers/json');
```


## AWS

Requests to AWS services need to have their headers signed. This can be accomplished by using the [`aws4`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws4) package. This is an example for querying an ["API Gateway"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/signing-requests/) with a signed request.

```js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const aws4 = require('aws4');
const got = require('got');

const chain = new AWS.CredentialProviderChain();

// Create a Got instance to use relative paths and signed requests
const awsClient = got.extend({
	baseUrl: 'https://<api-id>.execute-api.<api-region>.amazonaws.com/<stage>/',
	hooks: {
		beforeRequest: [
			async options => {
				const credentials = await chain.resolvePromise();
				aws4.sign(options, credentials);
			}
		]
	}
});

const response = await awsClient('endpoint/path', {
	// Request-specific options
});
```


## Testing

You can test your requests by using the [`nock`](https://github.com/node-nock/nock) package to mock an endpoint:

```js
const got = require('got');
const nock = require('nock');

nock('https://sindresorhus.com')
	.get('/')
	.reply(200, 'Hello world!');

(async () => {
	const response = await got('sindresorhus.com');
	console.log(response.body);
	//=> 'Hello world!'
})();
```

If you need real integration tests you can use [`create-test-server`](https://github.com/lukechilds/create-test-server):

```js
const got = require('got');
const createTestServer = require('create-test-server');

(async () => {
	const server = await createTestServer();
	server.get('/', 'Hello world!');

	const response = await got(server.url);
	console.log(response.body);
	//=> 'Hello world!'

	await server.close();
})();
```


## Tips

### User Agent

It's a good idea to set the `'user-agent'` header so the provider can more easily see how their resource is used. By default, it's the URL to this repo. You can omit this header by setting it to `null`.

```js
const got = require('got');
const pkg = require('./package.json');

got('sindresorhus.com', {
	headers: {
		'user-agent': `my-package/${pkg.version} (https://github.com/username/my-package)`
	}
});

got('sindresorhus.com', {
	headers: {
		'user-agent': null
	}
});
```

### 304 Responses

Bear in mind; if you send an `if-modified-since` header and receive a `304 Not Modified` response, the body will be empty. It's your responsibility to cache and retrieve the body contents.

### Custom endpoints

Use `got.extend()` to make it nicer to work with REST APIs. Especially if you use the `baseUrl` option.

**Note:** Not to be confused with [`got.create()`](advanced-creation.md), which has no defaults.

```js
const got = require('got');
const pkg = require('./package.json');

const custom = got.extend({
	baseUrl: 'example.com',
	json: true,
	headers: {
		'user-agent': `my-package/${pkg.version} (https://github.com/username/my-package)`
	}
});

// Use `custom` exactly how you use `got`
(async () => {
	const list = await custom('/v1/users/list');
})();
```

**Tip:** Need to merge some instances into a single one? Check out [`got.mergeInstances()`](advanced-creation.md#merging-instances).

### Experimental HTTP2 support

Got provides an experimental support for HTTP2 using the [`http2-wrapper`](https://github.com/szmarczak/http2-wrapper) package:

```js
const got = require('got');
const {request} = require('http2-wrapper');

const h2got = got.extend({request});

(async () => {
	const {body} = await h2got('https://nghttp2.org/httpbin/headers');
	console.log(body);
})();
```

# graceful-fs

graceful-fs functions as a drop-in replacement for the fs module,
making various improvements.

The improvements are meant to normalize behavior across different
platforms and environments, and to make filesystem access more
resilient to errors.

## Improvements over [fs module](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)

* Queues up `open` and `readdir` calls, and retries them once
  something closes if there is an EMFILE error from too many file
  descriptors.
* fixes `lchmod` for Node versions prior to 0.6.2.
* implements `fs.lutimes` if possible. Otherwise it becomes a noop.
* ignores `EINVAL` and `EPERM` errors in `chown`, `fchown` or
  `lchown` if the user isn't root.
* makes `lchmod` and `lchown` become noops, if not available.
* retries reading a file if `read` results in EAGAIN error.

On Windows, it retries renaming a file for up to one second if `EACCESS`
or `EPERM` error occurs, likely because antivirus software has locked
the directory.

## USAGE

```javascript
// use just like fs
var fs = require('graceful-fs')

// now go and do stuff with it...
fs.readFileSync('some-file-or-whatever')
```

## Global Patching

If you want to patch the global fs module (or any other fs-like
module) you can do this:

```javascript
// Make sure to read the caveat below.
var realFs = require('fs')
var gracefulFs = require('graceful-fs')
gracefulFs.gracefulify(realFs)
```

This should only ever be done at the top-level application layer, in
order to delay on EMFILE errors from any fs-using dependencies.  You
should **not** do this in a library, because it can cause unexpected
delays in other parts of the program.

## Changes

This module is fairly stable at this point, and used by a lot of
things.  That being said, because it implements a subtle behavior
change in a core part of the node API, even modest changes can be
extremely breaking, and the versioning is thus biased towards
bumping the major when in doubt.

The main change between major versions has been switching between
providing a fully-patched `fs` module vs monkey-patching the node core
builtin, and the approach by which a non-monkey-patched `fs` was
created.

The goal is to trade `EMFILE` errors for slower fs operations.  So, if
you try to open a zillion files, rather than crashing, `open`
operations will be queued up and wait for something else to `close`.

There are advantages to each approach.  Monkey-patching the fs means
that no `EMFILE` errors can possibly occur anywhere in your
application, because everything is using the same core `fs` module,
which is patched.  However, it can also obviously cause undesirable
side-effects, especially if the module is loaded multiple times.

Implementing a separate-but-identical patched `fs` module is more
surgical (and doesn't run the risk of patching multiple times), but
also imposes the challenge of keeping in sync with the core module.

The current approach loads the `fs` module, and then creates a
lookalike object that has all the same methods, except a few that are
patched.  It is safe to use in all versions of Node from 0.8 through
7.0.

### v4

* Do not monkey-patch the fs module.  This module may now be used as a
  drop-in dep, and users can opt into monkey-patching the fs builtin
  if their app requires it.

### v3

* Monkey-patch fs, because the eval approach no longer works on recent
  node.
* fixed possible type-error throw if rename fails on windows
* verify that we *never* get EMFILE errors
* Ignore ENOSYS from chmod/chown
* clarify that graceful-fs must be used as a drop-in

### v2.1.0

* Use eval rather than monkey-patching fs.
* readdir: Always sort the results
* win32: requeue a file if error has an OK status

### v2.0

* A return to monkey patching
* wrap process.cwd

### v1.1

* wrap readFile
* Wrap fs.writeFile.
* readdir protection
* Don't clobber the fs builtin
* Handle fs.read EAGAIN errors by trying again
* Expose the curOpen counter
* No-op lchown/lchmod if not implemented
* fs.rename patch only for win32
* Patch fs.rename to handle AV software on Windows
* Close #4 Chown should not fail on einval or eperm if non-root
* Fix isaacs/fstream#1 Only wrap fs one time
* Fix #3 Start at 1024 max files, then back off on EMFILE
* lutimes that doens't blow up on Linux
* A full on-rewrite using a queue instead of just swallowing the EMFILE error
* Wrap Read/Write streams as well

### 1.0

* Update engines for node 0.6
* Be lstat-graceful on Windows
* first

### [Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/http-cache-semantics/README.md](Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/http-cache-semantics/README.md)
# Can I cache this? [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kornelski/http-cache-semantics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kornelski/http-cache-semantics)

`CachePolicy` tells when responses can be reused from a cache, taking into account [HTTP RFC 7234](http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html) rules for user agents and shared caches.
It also implements [RFC 5861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5861), implementing `stale-if-error` and `stale-while-revalidate`.
It's aware of many tricky details such as the `Vary` header, proxy revalidation, and authenticated responses.

## Usage

Cacheability of an HTTP response depends on how it was requested, so both `request` and `response` are required to create the policy.

```js
const policy = new CachePolicy(request, response, options);

if (!policy.storable()) {
    // throw the response away, it's not usable at all
    return;
}

// Cache the data AND the policy object in your cache
// (this is pseudocode, roll your own cache (lru-cache package works))
letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.set(
    request.url,
    { policy, response },
    policy.timeToLive()
);
```

```js
// And later, when you receive a new request:
const { policy, response } = letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.get(newRequest.url);

// It's not enough that it exists in the cache, it has to match the new request, too:
if (policy && policy.satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)) {
    // OK, the previous response can be used to respond to the `newRequest`.
    // Response headers have to be updated, e.g. to add Age and remove uncacheable headers.
    response.headers = policy.responseHeaders();
    return response;
}
```

It may be surprising, but it's not enough for an HTTP response to be [fresh](#yo-fresh) to satisfy a request. It may need to match request headers specified in `Vary`. Even a matching fresh response may still not be usable if the new request restricted cacheability, etc.

The key method is `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)`, which checks whether the `newRequest` is compatible with the original request and whether all caching conditions are met.

### Constructor options

Request and response must have a `headers` property with all header names in lower case. `url`, `status` and `method` are optional (defaults are any URL, status `200`, and `GET` method).

```js
const request = {
    url: '/',
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        accept: '*/*',
    },
};

const response = {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
        'cache-control': 'public, max-age=7234',
    },
};

const options = {
    shared: true,
    cacheHeuristic: 0.1,
    immutableMinTimeToLive: 24 * 3600 * 1000, // 24h
    ignoreCargoCult: false,
};
```

If `options.shared` is `true` (default), then the response is evaluated from a perspective of a shared cache (i.e. `private` is not cacheable and `s-maxage` is respected). If `options.shared` is `false`, then the response is evaluated from a perspective of a single-user cache (i.e. `private` is cacheable and `s-maxage` is ignored). `shared: true` is recommended for HTTP clients.

`options.cacheHeuristic` is a fraction of response's age that is used as a fallback cache duration. The default is 0.1 (10%), e.g. if a file hasn't been modified for 100 days, it'll be cached for 100\*0.1 = 10 days.

`options.immutableMinTimeToLive` is a number of milliseconds to assume as the default time to cache responses with `Cache-Control: immutable`. Note that [per RFC](http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/immutable.html) these can become stale, so `max-age` still overrides the default.

If `options.ignoreCargoCult` is true, common anti-cache directives will be completely ignored if the non-standard `pre-check` and `post-check` directives are present. These two useless directives are most commonly found in bad StackOverflow answers and PHP's "session limiter" defaults.

### `storable()`

Returns `true` if the response can be stored in a cache. If it's `false` then you MUST NOT store either the request or the response.

### `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)`

This is the most important method. Use this method to check whether the cached response is still fresh in the context of the new request.

If it returns `true`, then the given `request` matches the original response this cache policy has been created with, and the response can be reused without contacting the server. Note that the old response can't be returned without being updated, see `responseHeaders()`.

If it returns `false`, then the response may not be matching at all (e.g. it's for a different URL or method), or may require to be refreshed first (see `revalidationHeaders()`).

### `responseHeaders()`

Returns updated, filtered set of response headers to return to clients receiving the cached response. This function is necessary, because proxies MUST always remove hop-by-hop headers (such as `TE` and `Connection`) and update response's `Age` to avoid doubling cache time.

```js
cachedResponse.headers = cachePolicy.responseHeaders(cachedResponse);
```

### `timeToLive()`

Returns approximate time in _milliseconds_ until the response becomes stale (i.e. not fresh).

After that time (when `timeToLive() <= 0`) the response might not be usable without revalidation. However, there are exceptions, e.g. a client can explicitly allow stale responses, so always check with `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation()`.
`stale-if-error` and `stale-while-revalidate` extend the time to live of the cache, that can still be used if stale.

### `toObject()`/`fromObject(json)`

Chances are you'll want to store the `CachePolicy` object along with the cached response. `obj = policy.toObject()` gives a plain JSON-serializable object. `policy = CachePolicy.fromObject(obj)` creates an instance from it.

### Refreshing stale cache (revalidation)

When a cached response has expired, it can be made fresh again by making a request to the origin server. The server may respond with status 304 (Not Modified) without sending the response body again, saving bandwidth.

The following methods help perform the update efficiently and correctly.

#### `revalidationHeaders(newRequest)`

Returns updated, filtered set of request headers to send to the origin server to check if the cached response can be reused. These headers allow the origin server to return status 304 indicating the response is still fresh. All headers unrelated to caching are passed through as-is.

Use this method when updating cache from the origin server.

```js
updateRequest.headers = cachePolicy.revalidationHeaders(updateRequest);
```

#### `revalidatedPolicy(revalidationRequest, revalidationResponse)`

Use this method to update the cache after receiving a new response from the origin server. It returns an object with two keys:

-   `policy` — A new `CachePolicy` with HTTP headers updated from `revalidationResponse`. You can always replace the old cached `CachePolicy` with the new one.
-   `modified` — Boolean indicating whether the response body has changed.
    -   If `false`, then a valid 304 Not Modified response has been received, and you can reuse the old cached response body. This is also affected by `stale-if-error`.
    -   If `true`, you should use new response's body (if present), or make another request to the origin server without any conditional headers (i.e. don't use `revalidationHeaders()` this time) to get the new resource.

```js
// When serving requests from cache:
const { oldPolicy, oldResponse } = letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.get(
    newRequest.url
);

if (!oldPolicy.satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)) {
    // Change the request to ask the origin server if the cached response can be used
    newRequest.headers = oldPolicy.revalidationHeaders(newRequest);

    // Send request to the origin server. The server may respond with status 304
    const newResponse = await makeRequest(newRequest);

    // Create updated policy and combined response from the old and new data
    const { policy, modified } = oldPolicy.revalidatedPolicy(
        newRequest,
        newResponse
    );
    const response = modified ? newResponse : oldResponse;

    // Update the cache with the newer/fresher response
    letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.set(
        newRequest.url,
        { policy, response },
        policy.timeToLive()
    );

    // And proceed returning cached response as usual
    response.headers = policy.responseHeaders();
    return response;
}
```

## Used by

-   [ImageOptim API](https://imageoptim.com/api), [make-fetch-happen](https://github.com/zkat/make-fetch-happen), [cacheable-request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cacheable-request) ([got](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got)), [npm/registry-fetch](https://github.com/npm/registry-fetch), [etc.](https://github.com/kornelski/http-cache-semantics/network/dependents)

## Implemented

-   `Cache-Control` response header with all the quirks.
-   `Expires` with check for bad clocks.
-   `Pragma` response header.
-   `Age` response header.
-   `Vary` response header.
-   Default cacheability of statuses and methods.
-   Requests for stale data.
-   Filtering of hop-by-hop headers.
-   Basic revalidation request
-   `stale-if-error`

## Unimplemented

-   Merging of range requests, `If-Range` (but correctly supports them as non-cacheable)
-   Revalidation of multiple representations

### Trusting server `Date`

Per the RFC, the cache should take into account the time between server-supplied `Date` and the time it received the response. The RFC-mandated behavior creates two problems:

 * Servers with incorrectly set timezone may add several hours to cache age (or more, if the clock is completely wrong).
 * Even reasonably correct clocks may be off by a couple of seconds, breaking `max-age=1` trick (which is useful for reverse proxies on high-traffic servers).

Previous versions of this library had an option to ignore the server date if it was "too inaccurate". To support the `max-age=1` trick the library also has to ignore dates that pretty accurate. There's no point of having an option to trust dates that are only a bit inaccurate, so this library won't trust any server dates. `max-age` will be interpreted from the time the response has been received, not from when it has been sent. This will affect only [RFC 1149 networks](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149).

Add callbacks to requests in flight to avoid async duplication

## USAGE

```javascript
var inflight = require('inflight')

// some request that does some stuff
function req(key, callback) {
  // key is any random string.  like a url or filename or whatever.
  //
  // will return either a falsey value, indicating that the

  // which when called will call all callbacks passed to inflightk
  // with the same key
  callback = inflight(key, callback)

  // If we got a falsey value back, then there's already a req going
  if (!callback) return

  // this is where you'd fetch the url or whatever
  // callback is also once()-ified, so it can safely be assigned
  // to multiple events etc.  First call wins.

### [Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/inherits/README.md](Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/inherits/README.md)
Browser-friendly inheritance fully compatible with standard node.js
[inherits](http://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inherits_constructor_superconstructor).

This package exports standard `inherits` from node.js `util` module in
node environment, but also provides alternative browser-friendly
implementation through [browser
field](https://gist.github.com/shtylman/4339901). Alternative
implementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone
module to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old
browsers with no `Object.create` support.

While keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`
implementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as
[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not
include full `util` package to your client code if all you need is
just `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`
package is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need
from it.

It's recommended to use this package instead of
`require('util').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used
not only in node.js but in browser too.

## usage

```js
var inherits = require('inherits');
// then use exactly as the standard one
```

## note on version ~1.0

Version ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible
neither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.

If you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be
careful:

* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing
  superclass
* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any
  existing fields on it

var isGlob = require('is-glob');
```

### Default behavior

**True**

Patterns that have glob characters or regex patterns will return `true`:

```js
isGlob('!foo.js');
isGlob('*.js');
isGlob('**/abc.js');
isGlob('abc/*.js');
isGlob('abc/(aaa|bbb).js');
isGlob('abc/[a-z].js');
isGlob('abc/{a,b}.js');
//=> true
```

Extglobs

```js
isGlob('abc/@(a).js');
isGlob('abc/!(a).js');
isGlob('abc/+(a).js');
isGlob('abc/*(a).js');
isGlob('abc/?(a).js');
//=> true
```

**False**

Escaped globs or extglobs return `false`:

```js
isGlob('abc/\\@(a).js');
isGlob('abc/\\!(a).js');
isGlob('abc/\\+(a).js');
isGlob('abc/\\*(a).js');
isGlob('abc/\\?(a).js');
isGlob('\\!foo.js');
isGlob('\\*.js');
isGlob('\\*\\*/abc.js');
isGlob('abc/\\*.js');
isGlob('abc/\\(aaa|bbb).js');
isGlob('abc/\\[a-z].js');
isGlob('abc/\\{a,b}.js');
//=> false
```

Patterns that do not have glob patterns return `false`:

```js
isGlob('abc.js');
isGlob('abc/def/ghi.js');
isGlob('foo.js');
isGlob('abc/@.js');
isGlob('abc/+.js');
isGlob('abc/?.js');
isGlob();
isGlob(null);
//=> false
```

Arrays are also `false` (If you want to check if an array has a glob pattern, use [has-glob](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/has-glob)):

```js
isGlob(['**/*.js']);
isGlob(['foo.js']);
//=> false
```

### Option strict

When `options.strict === false` the behavior is less strict in determining if a pattern is a glob. Meaning that
some patterns that would return `false` may return `true`. This is done so that matching libraries like [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) have a chance at determining if the pattern is a glob or not.

**True**

Patterns that have glob characters or regex patterns will return `true`:

```js
isGlob('!foo.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('*.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('**/abc.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/*.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/(aaa|bbb).js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/[a-z].js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/{a,b}.js', {strict: false});
//=> true
```

Extglobs

```js
isGlob('abc/@(a).js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/!(a).js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/+(a).js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/*(a).js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/?(a).js', {strict: false});
//=> true
```

**False**

Escaped globs or extglobs return `false`:

```js
isGlob('\\!foo.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('\\*.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('\\*\\*/abc.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/\\*.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/\\(aaa|bbb).js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/\\[a-z].js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/\\{a,b}.js', {strict: false});
//=> false
```

# is-number [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/is-number.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-number) [![NPM monthly downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/is-number.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/is-number) [![NPM total downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/is-number.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/is-number) [![Linux Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jonschlinkert/is-number.svg?style=flat&label=Travis)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/is-number)

> Returns true if the value is a finite number.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save is-number
```

## Why is this needed?

In JavaScript, it's not always as straightforward as it should be to reliably check if a value is a number. It's common for devs to use `+`, `-`, or `Number()` to cast a string value to a number (for example, when values are returned from user input, regex matches, parsers, etc). But there are many non-intuitive edge cases that yield unexpected results:

```js
console.log(+[]); //=> 0
console.log(+''); //=> 0
console.log(+'   '); //=> 0
console.log(typeof NaN); //=> 'number'
```

This library offers a performant way to smooth out edge cases like these.

## Usage

```js
const isNumber = require('is-number');
```

See the [tests](./test.js) for more examples.

### true

```js
isNumber(5e3);               // true
isNumber(0xff);              // true
isNumber(-1.1);              // true
isNumber(0);                 // true
isNumber(1);                 // true
isNumber(1.1);               // true
isNumber(10);                // true
isNumber(10.10);             // true
isNumber(100);               // true
isNumber('-1.1');            // true
isNumber('0');               // true
isNumber('012');             // true
isNumber('0xff');            // true
isNumber('1');               // true
isNumber('1.1');             // true
isNumber('10');              // true
isNumber('10.10');           // true
isNumber('100');             // true
isNumber('5e3');             // true
isNumber(parseInt('012'));   // true
isNumber(parseFloat('012')); // true
```

### False

Everything else is false, as you would expect:

```js
isNumber(Infinity);          // false
isNumber(NaN);               // false
isNumber(null);              // false
isNumber(undefined);         // false
isNumber('');                // false
isNumber('   ');             // false
isNumber('foo');             // false
isNumber([1]);               // false
isNumber([]);                // false
isNumber(function () {});    // false
isNumber({});                // false
```

## Release history

### 7.0.0

* Refactor. Now uses `.isFinite` if it exists.
* Performance is about the same as v6.0 when the value is a string or number. But it's now 3x-4x faster when the value is not a string or number.

### 6.0.0

* Optimizations, thanks to @benaadams.

### 5.0.0

**Breaking changes**

* removed support for `instanceof Number` and `instanceof String`

# json-buffer

JSON functions that can convert buffers!

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dominictarr/json-buffer.png)](http://travis-ci.org/dominictarr/json-buffer)

[![testling badge](https://ci.testling.com/dominictarr/json-buffer.png)](https://ci.testling.com/dominictarr/json-buffer)

JSON mangles buffers by converting to an array...
which isn't helpful. json-buffers converts to base64 instead,
and deconverts base64 to a buffer.

``` js
var JSONB = require('json-buffer')
var Buffer = require('buffer').Buffer

var str = JSONB.stringify(new Buffer('hello there!'))

console.log(JSONB.parse(str)) //GET a BUFFER back
```

Node.js - jsonfile
================

Easily read/write JSON files in Node.js. _Note: this module cannot be used in the browser._

[![npm Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/jsonfile.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jsonfile)
[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jprichardson/node-jsonfile.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/jprichardson/node-jsonfile)

<a href="https://github.com/feross/standard"><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/sticker.svg" alt="Standard JavaScript" width="100"></a>

Why?
----

Writing `JSON.stringify()` and then `fs.writeFile()` and `JSON.parse()` with `fs.readFile()` enclosed in `try/catch` blocks became annoying.



Installation
------------

    npm install --save jsonfile



API
---

* [`readFile(filename, [options], callback)`](#readfilefilename-options-callback)
* [`readFileSync(filename, [options])`](#readfilesyncfilename-options)
* [`writeFile(filename, obj, [options], callback)`](#writefilefilename-obj-options-callback)
* [`writeFileSync(filename, obj, [options])`](#writefilesyncfilename-obj-options)

----

### readFile(filename, [options], callback)

`options` (`object`, default `undefined`): Pass in any [`fs.readFile`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_path_options_callback) options or set `reviver` for a [JSON reviver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).
  - `throws` (`boolean`, default: `true`). If `JSON.parse` throws an error, pass this error to the callback.
  If `false`, returns `null` for the object.


```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')
const file = '/tmp/data.json'
jsonfile.readFile(file, function (err, obj) {
  if (err) console.error(err)
  console.dir(obj)
})
```

You can also use this method with promises. The `readFile` method will return a promise if you do not pass a callback function.

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')
const file = '/tmp/data.json'
jsonfile.readFile(file)
  .then(obj => console.dir(obj))
  .catch(error => console.error(error))
```

----

### readFileSync(filename, [options])

`options` (`object`, default `undefined`): Pass in any [`fs.readFileSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfilesync_path_options) options or set `reviver` for a [JSON reviver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).
- `throws` (`boolean`, default: `true`). If an error is encountered reading or parsing the file, throw the error. If `false`, returns `null` for the object.

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')
const file = '/tmp/data.json'

console.dir(jsonfile.readFileSync(file))
```

----

### writeFile(filename, obj, [options], callback)

`options`: Pass in any [`fs.writeFile`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefile_file_data_options_callback) options or set `replacer` for a [JSON replacer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify). Can also pass in `spaces`, or override `EOL` string or set `finalEOL` flag as `false` to not save the file with `EOL` at the end.


```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFile(file, obj, function (err) {
  if (err) console.error(err)
})
```
Or use with promises as follows:

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFile(file, obj)
  .then(res => {
    console.log('Write complete')
  })
  .catch(error => console.error(error))
```


**formatting with spaces:**

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFile(file, obj, { spaces: 2 }, function (err) {
  if (err) console.error(err)
})
```

**overriding EOL:**

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFile(file, obj, { spaces: 2, EOL: '\r\n' }, function (err) {
  if (err) console.error(err)
})
```


**disabling the EOL at the end of file:**

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFile(file, obj, { spaces: 2, finalEOL: false }, function (err) {
  if (err) console.log(err)
})
```

**appending to an existing JSON file:**

You can use `fs.writeFile` option `{ flag: 'a' }` to achieve this.

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/mayAlreadyExistedData.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFile(file, obj, { flag: 'a' }, function (err) {
  if (err) console.error(err)
})
```

----

### writeFileSync(filename, obj, [options])

`options`: Pass in any [`fs.writeFileSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefilesync_file_data_options) options or set `replacer` for a [JSON replacer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify). Can also pass in `spaces`, or override `EOL` string or set `finalEOL` flag as `false` to not save the file with `EOL` at the end.

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFileSync(file, obj)
```

**formatting with spaces:**

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFileSync(file, obj, { spaces: 2 })
```

**overriding EOL:**

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFileSync(file, obj, { spaces: 2, EOL: '\r\n' })
```

**disabling the EOL at the end of file:**

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFileSync(file, obj, { spaces: 2, finalEOL: false })
```

**appending to an existing JSON file:**

You can use `fs.writeFileSync` option `{ flag: 'a' }` to achieve this.

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/mayAlreadyExistedData.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFileSync(file, obj, { flag: 'a' })
```

> Simple key-value storage with support for multiple backends

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/keyv/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/keyv?branch=master)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/keyv.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/keyv.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv)

Keyv provides a consistent interface for key-value storage across multiple backends via storage adapters. It supports TTL based expiry, making it suitable as a cache or a persistent key-value store.

## Features

There are a few existing modules similar to Keyv, however Keyv is different because it:

- Isn't bloated
- Has a simple Promise based API
- Suitable as a TTL based cache or persistent key-value store
- [Easily embeddable](#add-cache-support-to-your-module) inside another module
- Works with any storage that implements the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) API
- Handles all JSON types plus `Buffer`
- Supports namespaces
- Wide range of [**efficient, well tested**](#official-storage-adapters) storage adapters
- Connection errors are passed through (db failures won't kill your app)
- Supports the current active LTS version of Node.js or higher

## Usage

Install Keyv.

```
npm install --save keyv
```

By default everything is stored in memory, you can optionally also install a storage adapter.

```
npm install --save @keyv/redis
npm install --save @keyv/mongo
npm install --save @keyv/sqlite
npm install --save @keyv/postgres
npm install --save @keyv/mysql
```

Create a new Keyv instance, passing your connection string if applicable. Keyv will automatically load the correct storage adapter.

```js
const Keyv = require('keyv');

// One of the following
const keyv = new Keyv();
const keyv = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379');
const keyv = new Keyv('mongodb://user:pass@localhost:27017/dbname');
const keyv = new Keyv('sqlite://path/to/database.sqlite');
const keyv = new Keyv('postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname');
const keyv = new Keyv('mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/dbname');

// Handle DB connection errors
keyv.on('error', err => console.log('Connection Error', err));

await keyv.set('foo', 'expires in 1 second', 1000); // true
await keyv.set('foo', 'never expires'); // true
await keyv.get('foo'); // 'never expires'
await keyv.delete('foo'); // true
await keyv.clear(); // undefined
```

### Namespaces

You can namespace your Keyv instance to avoid key collisions and allow you to clear only a certain namespace while using the same database.

```js
const users = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'users' });
const cache = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'cache' });

await users.set('foo', 'users'); // true
await cache.set('foo', 'cache'); // true
await users.get('foo'); // 'users'
await cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'
await users.clear(); // undefined
await users.get('foo'); // undefined
await cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'
```

### Custom Serializers

Keyv uses [`json-buffer`](https://github.com/dominictarr/json-buffer) for data serialization to ensure consistency across different backends.

You can optionally provide your own serialization functions to support extra data types or to serialize to something other than JSON.

```js
const keyv = new Keyv({ serialize: JSON.stringify, deserialize: JSON.parse });
```

**Warning:** Using custom serializers means you lose any guarantee of data consistency. You should do extensive testing with your serialisation functions and chosen storage engine.

## Official Storage Adapters

The official storage adapters are covered by [over 150 integration tests](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv/jobs/260418145) to guarantee consistent behaviour. They are lightweight, efficient wrappers over the DB clients making use of indexes and native TTLs where available.

Database | Adapter | Native TTL | Status
---|---|---|---
Redis | [@keyv/redis](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv-redis) | Yes | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-redis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-redis) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/keyv-redis/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/keyv-redis?branch=master)
MongoDB | [@keyv/mongo](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv-mongo) | Yes | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-mongo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-mongo) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/keyv-mongo/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/keyv-mongo?branch=master)
SQLite | [@keyv/sqlite](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv-sqlite) | No | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-sqlite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-sqlite) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/keyv-sqlite/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/keyv-sqlite?branch=master)
PostgreSQL | [@keyv/postgres](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv-postgres) | No | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-postgres.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechildskeyv-postgreskeyv) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/keyv-postgres/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/keyv-postgres?branch=master)
MySQL | [@keyv/mysql](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv-mysql) | No | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-mysql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-mysql) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/keyv-mysql/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/keyv-mysql?branch=master)

## Third-party Storage Adapters

You can also use third-party storage adapters or build your own. Keyv will wrap these storage adapters in TTL functionality and handle complex types internally.

```js
const Keyv = require('keyv');
const myAdapter = require('./my-storage-adapter');

const keyv = new Keyv({ store: myAdapter });
```

Any store that follows the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) api will work.

```js
new Keyv({ store: new Map() });
```

For example, [`quick-lru`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) is a completely unrelated module that implements the Map API.

```js
const Keyv = require('keyv');
const QuickLRU = require('quick-lru');

const lru = new QuickLRU({ maxSize: 1000 });
const keyv = new Keyv({ store: lru });
```

The following are third-party storage adapters compatible with Keyv:

- [quick-lru](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) - Simple "Least Recently Used" (LRU) cache
- [keyv-file](https://github.com/zaaack/keyv-file) - File system storage adapter for Keyv
- [keyv-dynamodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-dynamodb) - DynamoDB storage adapter for Keyv

## Add Cache Support to your Module

Keyv is designed to be easily embedded into other modules to add cache support. The recommended pattern is to expose a `cache` option in your modules options which is passed through to Keyv. Caching will work in memory by default and users have the option to also install a Keyv storage adapter and pass in a connection string, or any other storage that implements the `Map` API.

You should also set a namespace for your module so you can safely call `.clear()` without clearing unrelated app data.

Inside your module:

```js
class AwesomeModule {
	constructor(opts) {
		this.cache = new Keyv({
			uri: typeof opts.cache === 'string' && opts.cache,
			store: typeof opts.cache !== 'string' && opts.cache,
			namespace: 'awesome-module'
		});
	}
}
```

Now it can be consumed like this:

```js
const AwesomeModule = require('awesome-module');

// Caches stuff in memory by default
const awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule();

// After npm install --save keyv-redis
const awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: 'redis://localhost' });

// Some third-party module that implements the Map API
const awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: some3rdPartyStore });
```

## API

### new Keyv([uri], [options])

Returns a new Keyv instance.

The Keyv instance is also an `EventEmitter` that will emit an `'error'` event if the storage adapter connection fails.

### uri

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `undefined`

The connection string URI.

Merged into the options object as options.uri.

### options

Type: `Object`

The options object is also passed through to the storage adapter. Check your storage adapter docs for any extra options.

#### options.namespace

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `'keyv'`

Namespace for the current instance.

#### options.ttl

Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Default TTL. Can be overridden by specififying a TTL on `.set()`.

#### options.serialize

Type: `Function`<br>
Default: `JSONB.stringify`

A custom serialization function.

#### options.deserialize

Type: `Function`<br>
Default: `JSONB.parse`

A custom deserialization function.

#### options.store

Type: `Storage adapter instance`<br>
Default: `new Map()`

The storage adapter instance to be used by Keyv.

#### options.adapter

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Specify an adapter to use. e.g `'redis'` or `'mongodb'`.

### Instance

Keys must always be strings. Values can be of any type.

#### .set(key, value, [ttl])

Set a value.

By default keys are persistent. You can set an expiry TTL in milliseconds.

Returns `true`.

#### .get(key)

Returns the value.

#### .delete(key)

Deletes an entry.

Returns `true` if the key existed, `false` if not.

#### .clear()

Delete all entries in the current namespace.

Returns `undefined`.

[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#weekly-quick-snips)

## ➤ Weekly-Quick-Snips:
---
#### Snippet of the Day:


### replaceAll 
the method string.replaceAll(search, replaceWith) replaces all appearances of search string with replaceWith.
```javascript


const str = 'this is a JSsnippets example';

const updatedStr = str.replace('example', 'snippet'); // 'this is a  JSsnippets snippet'


The tricky part is that replace method replaces only the very first match of the substring we have passed:


const str = 'this is a JSsnippets example and examples are great';

const updatedStr = str.replace('example', 'snippet'); //'this is a JSsnippets snippet and examples are great'

In order to go through this, we need to use a global regexp instead:


const str = 'this is a JSsnippets example and examples are great';

const updatedStr = str.replace(/example/g, 'snippet'); //'this is a JSsnippets snippet and snippets are greatr'

but now we have new friend in town, replaceAll

const str = 'this is a JSsnippets example and examples are great';

const updatedStr = str.replaceAll('example', 'snippet'); //'this is a JSsnippets snippet and snippets are greatr'

```

### Fibonacci in Python:

```py
def fib_iter(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    p0 = 0
    p1 = 1
    for i in range(n-1):
        next_val = p0 + p1
        p0 = p1
        p1 = next_val
    return next_val
for i in range(10):
    print(f'{i}: {fib_iter(i)}')
```

 #### Yesterday's Snippet of the day:

---

```py
def quicksort(l):
    # One of our base cases is an empty list or list with one element
    if len(l) == 0 or len(l) == 1:
        return l
    # If we have a left list, a pivot point and a right list...
    # assigns the return values of the partition() function
    left, pivot, right = partition(l) 
    # Our sorted list looks like left + pivot + right, but sorted.
    # Pivot has to be in brackets to be a list, so python can concatenate all the elements to a single list
    return quicksort(left) + [pivot] + quicksort(right)



print(quicksort([]))



print(quicksort([1]))



print(quicksort([1,2]))

print(quicksort([2,1]))


print(quicksort([2,2]))


print(quicksort([5,3,9,4,8,1,7]))


print(quicksort([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]))


print(quicksort([9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]))

# <a id="asymptotic-notation"></a>Asymptotic Notation
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition:
Asymptotic Notation is the hardware independent notation used to tell the time and space complexity of an algorithm. Meaning it's a standardized way of measuring how much memory an algorithm uses or how long it runs for given an input.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Complexities
The following are the Asymptotic rates of growth from best to worst:
- constant growth - ``O(1)`` Runtime is constant and does not grow with `n`
- logarithmic growth – ``O(log n)`` Runtime grows logarithmically in proportion to `n`
- linear growth – ``O(n)`` Runtime grows directly in proportion to `n`
- superlinear growth – ``O(n log n)`` Runtime grows in proportion _and_ logarithmically to `n`
- polynomial growth – `O(n^c)` Runtime grows quicker than previous all based on `n`
- exponential growth – `O(c^n)` Runtime grows even faster than polynomial growth based on `n`
- factorial growth – `O(n!)` Runtime grows the fastest and becomes quickly unusable for even
small values of `n`

###   <span style="color:red;"> Big-O notation
Big-O refers to the upper bound of time or space complexity of an algorithm, meaning it worst case runtime scenario. An easy way to think of it is that runtime could be better than Big-O but it will never be worse.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Big-Ω (Big-Omega) notation
Big-Omega refers to the lower bound of time or space complexity of an algorithm, meaning it is the best runtime scenario. Or runtime could worse than Big-Omega, but it will never be better.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Big-θ (Big-Theta) notation
Big-Theta refers to the tight bound of time or space complexity of an algorithm. Another way to think of it is the intersection of Big-O and Big-Omega, or more simply runtime is guaranteed to be a given complexity, such as `n log n`.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Big-O and Big-Theta are the most common and helpful notations
- Big-O does _not_ mean Worst Case Scenario, Big-Theta does _not_ mean average case, and Big-Omega does _not_ mean Best Case Scenario. They only connote the algorithm's performance for a particular scenario, and all three can be used for any scenario.
- Worst Case means given an unideal input, Average Case means given a typical input, Best case means a ideal input. Ex. Worst case means given an input the algorithm performs particularly bad, or best case an already sorted array for a sorting algorithm.
- Best Case and Big Omega are generally not helpful since Best Cases are rare in the real world and lower bound might be very different than an upper bound.
- Big-O isn't everything. On paper merge sort is faster than quick sort, but in practice quick sort is superior.
# <a id="data-structures"></a>Data Structures
###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="array"></a> Array
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- Stores data elements based on an sequential, most commonly 0 based, index.
- Based on [tuples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple) from set theory.
- They are one of the oldest, most commonly used data structures.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Optimal for indexing; bad at searching, inserting, and deleting (except at the end).
- **Linear arrays**, or one dimensional arrays, are the most basic.
  - Are static in size, meaning that they are declared with a fixed size.
- **Dynamic arrays** are like one dimensional arrays, but have reserved space for additional elements.
  - If a dynamic array is full, it copies its contents to a larger array.
- **Multi dimensional arrays** nested arrays that allow for multiple dimensions such as an array of arrays providing a 2 dimensional spacial representation via x, y coordinates.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Time Complexity
- Indexing:         Linear array: `O(1)`,      Dynamic array: `O(1)`
- Search:           Linear array: `O(n)`,      Dynamic array: `O(n)`
- Optimized Search: Linear array: `O(log n)`,  Dynamic array: `O(log n)`
- Insertion:        Linear array: n/a,         Dynamic array: `O(n)`
###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="linked-list"></a> Linked List
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- Stores data with **nodes** that point to other nodes.
  - Nodes, at its most basic it has one datum and one reference (another node).
  - A linked list _chains_ nodes together by pointing one node's reference towards another node.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Designed to optimize insertion and deletion, slow at indexing and searching.
- **Doubly linked list** has nodes that also reference the previous node.
- **Circularly linked list** is simple linked list whose **tail**, the last node, references the **head**, the first node.
- **Stack**, commonly implemented with linked lists but can be made from arrays too.
  - Stacks are **last in, first out** (LIFO) data structures.
  - Made with a linked list by having the head be the only place for insertion and removal.
- **Queues**, too can be implemented with a linked list or an array.
  - Queues are a **first in, first out** (FIFO) data structure.
  - Made with a doubly linked list that only removes from head and adds to tail.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Time Complexity
- Indexing:         Linked Lists: `O(n)`
- Search:           Linked Lists: `O(n)`
- Optimized Search: Linked Lists: `O(n)`
- Append:           Linked Lists: `O(1)`
- Prepend:          Linked Lists: `O(1)`
- Insertion:        Linked Lists: `O(n)`
###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="hash"></a> Hash Table or Hash Map
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- Stores data with key value pairs.
- **Hash functions** accept a key and return an output unique only to that specific key.
  - This is known as **hashing**, which is the concept that an input and an output have a one-to-one correspondence to map information.
  - Hash functions return a unique address in memory for that data.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Designed to optimize searching, insertion, and deletion.
- **Hash collisions** are when a hash function returns the same output for two distinct inputs.
  - All hash functions have this problem.
  - This is often accommodated for by having the hash tables be very large.
- Hashes are important for associative arrays and database indexing.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Time Complexity
- Indexing:         Hash Tables: `O(1)`
- Search:           Hash Tables: `O(1)`
- Insertion:        Hash Tables: `O(1)`
###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="binary-tree"></a> Binary Tree
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- Is a tree like data structure where every node has at most two children.
  - There is one left and right child node.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Designed to optimize searching and sorting.
- A **degenerate tree** is an unbalanced tree, which if entirely one-sided, is essentially a linked list.
- They are comparably simple to implement than other data structures.
- Used to make **binary search trees**.
  - A binary tree that uses comparable keys to assign which direction a child is.
  - Left child has a key smaller than its parent node.
  - Right child has a key greater than its parent node.
  - There can be no duplicate node.
  - Because of the above it is more likely to be used as a data structure than a binary tree.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Time Complexity
- Indexing:  Binary Search Tree: `O(log n)`
- Search:    Binary Search Tree: `O(log n)`
- Insertion: Binary Search Tree: `O(log n)`
# <a id="algorithms"></a> Algorithms
## <a id="algorithm-basics"></a> Algorithm Basics
###   <span style="color:red;"> Recursive Algorithms
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- An algorithm that calls itself in its definition.
  - **Recursive case** a conditional statement that is used to trigger the recursion.
  - **Base case** a conditional statement that is used to break the recursion.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- **Stack level too deep** and **stack overflow**.
  - If you've seen either of these from a recursive algorithm, you messed up.
  - It means that your base case was never triggered because it was faulty or the problem was so massive you ran out of alloted memory.
  - Knowing whether or not you will reach a base case is integral to correctly using recursion.
  - Often used in Depth First Search
###   <span style="color:red;"> Iterative Algorithms
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- An algorithm that is called repeatedly but for a finite number of times, each time being a single iteration.
  - Often used to move incrementally through a data set.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Generally you will see iteration as loops, for, while, and until statements.
- Think of iteration as moving one at a time through a set.
- Often used to move through an array.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Recursion Vs. Iteration
- The differences between recursion and iteration can be confusing to distinguish since both can be used to implement the other. But know that,
  - Recursion is, usually, more expressive and easier to implement.
  - Iteration uses less memory.
- **Functional languages** tend to use recursion. (i.e. Haskell)
- **Imperative languages** tend to use iteration. (i.e. Ruby)
- Check out this [Stack Overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19794739/what-is-the-difference-between-iteration-and-recursion) for more info.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Greedy Algorithms
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- An algorithm that, while executing, selects only the information that meets a certain criteria.
- The general five components, taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm#Specifics):
  - A candidate set, from which a solution is created.
  - A selection function, which chooses the best candidate to be added to the solution.
  - A feasibility function, that is used to determine if a candidate can be used to contribute to a solution.
  - An objective function, which assigns a value to a solution, or a partial solution.
  - A solution function, which will indicate when we have discovered a complete solution.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Used to find the expedient, though non-optimal, solution for a given problem.
- Generally used on sets of data where only a small proportion of the information evaluated meets the desired result.
- Often a greedy algorithm can help reduce the Big O of an algorithm.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Pseudo Code of a Greedy Algorithm to Find Largest Difference of any Two Numbers in an Array.
```
greedy algorithm (array)
  let largest difference = 0
  let new difference = find next difference (array[n], array[n+1])
  largest difference = new difference if new difference is > largest difference
  repeat above two steps until all differences have been found
  return largest difference
```
This algorithm never needed to compare all the differences to one another, saving it an entire iteration.
## <a id="search-algorithms"></a>Search Algorithms
###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="breadth-first-search"></a>Breadth First Search
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- An algorithm that searches a tree (or graph) by searching levels of the tree first, starting at the root.
  - It finds every node on the same level, most often moving left to right.
  - While doing this it tracks the children nodes of the nodes on the current level.
  - When finished examining a level it moves to the left most node on the next level.
  - The bottom-right most node is evaluated last (the node that is deepest and is farthest right of it's level).
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Optimal for searching a tree that is wider than it is deep.
- Uses a queue to store information about the tree while it traverses a tree.
  - Because it uses a queue it is more memory intensive than **depth first search**.
  - The queue uses more memory because it needs to stores pointers
###   <span style="color:red;"> Time Complexity
- Search: Breadth First Search: O(V + E)
- E is number of edges
- V is number of vertices
###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="depth-first-search"></a>Depth First Search
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- An algorithm that searches a tree (or graph) by searching depth of the tree first, starting at the root.
  - It traverses left down a tree until it cannot go further.
  - Once it reaches the end of a branch it traverses back up trying the right child of nodes on that branch, and if possible left from the right children.
  - When finished examining a branch it moves to the node right of the root then tries to go left on all it's children until it reaches the bottom.
  - The right most node is evaluated last (the node that is right of all it's ancestors).
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Optimal for searching a tree that is deeper than it is wide.
- Uses a stack to push nodes onto.
  - Because a stack is LIFO it does not need to keep track of the nodes pointers and is therefore less memory intensive than breadth first search.
  - Once it cannot go further left it begins evaluating the stack.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Time Complexity
- Search: Depth First Search: O(|E| + |V|)
- E is number of edges
- V is number of vertices
###   <span style="color:red;"> Breadth First Search Vs. Depth First Search
- The simple answer to this question is that it depends on the size and shape of the tree.
  - For wide, shallow trees use Breadth First Search
  - For deep, narrow trees use Depth First Search
###   <span style="color:red;"> Nuances
  - Because BFS uses queues to store information about the nodes and its children, it could use more memory than is available on your computer. (But you probably won't have to worry about this.)
  - If using a DFS on a tree that is very deep you might go unnecessarily deep in the search. See [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/761/) for more information.
  - Breadth First Search tends to be a looping algorithm.
  - Depth First Search tends to be a recursive algorithm.
## <a id="sorting-algorithms"></a>Sorting Algorithms
###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="selection-sort"></a>Selection Sort
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- A comparison based sorting algorithm.
  - Starts with the cursor on the left, iterating left to right
  - Compares the left side to the right, looking for the smallest known item
    - If the left is smaller than the item to the right it continues iterating
    - If the left is bigger than the item to the right, the item on the right becomes the known smallest number
    - Once it has checked all items, it moves the known smallest to the cursor and advances the cursor to the right and starts over
  - As the algorithm processes the data set, it builds a fully sorted left side of the data until the entire data set is sorted
- Changes the array in place.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Inefficient for large data sets.
- Very simple to implement.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Time Complexity
- Best Case Sort: Merge Sort: `O(n^2)`
- Average Case Sort: Merge Sort: `O(n^2)`
- Worst Case Sort: Merge Sort: `O(n^2)`
###   <span style="color:red;"> Space Complexity
- Worst Case: `O(1)`

###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="insertion-sort"></a>Insertion Sort
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- A comparison based sorting algorithm.
  - Iterates left to right comparing the current cursor to the previous item.
  - If the cursor is smaller than the item on the left it swaps positions and the cursor compares itself again to the left hand side until it is put in its sorted position.
  - As the algorithm processes the data set, the left side becomes increasingly sorted until it is fully sorted.
- Changes the array in place.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Inefficient for large data sets, but can be faster for than other algorithms for small ones.
- Although it has an `O(n^2)`, in practice it slightly less since its comparison scheme only requires checking place if its smaller than its neighbor.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Time Complexity
- Best Case: `O(n)`
- Average Case: `O(n^2)`
- Worst Case: `O(n^2)`
###   <span style="color:red;"> Space Complexity

###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- A divide and conquer algorithm.
  - Recursively divides entire array by half into subsets until the subset is one, the base case.
  - Once the base case is reached results are returned and sorted ascending left to right.
  - Recursive calls are returned and the sorts double in size until the entire array is sorted.

###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="quick-sort"></a>Quicksort
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- A divide and conquer algorithm
  - Partitions entire data set in half by selecting a random pivot element and putting all smaller elements to the left of the element and larger ones to the right.
  - It repeats this process on the left side until it is comparing only two elements at which point the left side is sorted.
  - When the left side is finished sorting it performs the same operation on the right side.
- Computer architecture favors the quicksort process.
- Changes the array in place.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- While it has the same Big O as (or worse in some cases) many other sorting algorithms it is often faster in practice than many other sorting algorithms, such as merge sort.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Merge Sort Vs. Quicksort
- Quicksort is likely faster in practice, but merge sort is faster on paper.
- Merge Sort divides the set into the smallest possible groups immediately then reconstructs the incrementally as it sorts the groupings.
- Quicksort continually partitions the data set by a pivot, until the set is recursively sorted.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is ARIA and when should you use it?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
ARIA stands for "Accessible Rich Internet Applications", and is a technical specification created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Better known as WAI-ARIA, it provides additional HTML attributes in the development of web applications to offer people who use assistive technologies (AT) a more robust and interoperable experience with dynamic components. By providing the component's role, name, and state, AT users can better understand how to interact with the component. WAI-ARIA should only be used when an HTML element equivalent is not available or lacks full browser or AT support. WAI-ARIA's semantic markup coupled with JavaScript works to provide an understandable and interactive experience for people who use AT.
An example using ARIA:
    <div 
      role="combobox"
      aria-expanded="false"
      aria-owns="ex1-grid"
      aria-haspopup="grid"
      id="ex1-combobox">
      ...
    </div>

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the minimum recommended ratio of contrast between foreground text and background to comply with WCAG? Why does this matter?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
4.5:1 is the calculated contrast ratio between foreground text and background that is recommended by the Web Content Accessibiity Guidelines (WCAG) success criteria (SC) 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum). This SC was written by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure that people with low vision or color deficiencies are able to read (perceive) important content on a web page. It goes beyond color choices to ensure text stands out on the background it's placed on.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
There are multiple tools that can help you to find for accessibility issues in your website or application.
Check for issues in your website:
-   Lighthouse from Google, it provides an option for accessibility testing, it will check for the compliance of different accessibility standards and give you an score with details on the different issues
-   Axe Coconut from DequeLabs, it is a Chrome extension that adds a tab in the Developer tools, it will check for accessibility issues and it will classify them by severity and suggest possible solutions
Check for issues in your code: \* Jest Axe, you can add unit tests for accessibility \* React Axe, test your React application with the axe-core accessibility testing library. Results will show in the Chrome DevTools console. \* eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, pairing this plugin with an editor lint plugin, you can bake accessibility standards into your application in real-time.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the Accessibility Tree?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The Accessibility Tree is a structure produced by the browser's Accessibility APIs which provides accessibility information to assistive technologies such as screen readers. It runs parallel to the DOM and is similar to the DOM API, but with much fewer nodes, because a lot of that information is only useful for visual presentation. By writing semantic HTML we can take advantage of this process in creating an accessible experience for our users.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute on images?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The `alt` attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user cannot view it. The `alt` attribute should be used to describe any images except those which only serve a decorative purpose, in which case it should be left empty.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Decorative images should have an empty `alt` attribute.
-   Web crawlers use `alt` tags to understand image content, so they are considered important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
-   Put the `.` at the end of `alt` tag to improve accessibility.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are `defer` and `async` attributes on a `<script>` tag?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
If neither attribute is present, the script is downloaded and executed synchronously, and will halt parsing of the document until it has finished executing (default behavior). Scripts are downloaded and executed in the order they are encountered.
The `defer` attribute downloads the script while the document is still parsing but waits until the document has finished parsing before executing it, equivalent to executing inside a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener. `defer` scripts will execute in order.
The `async` attribute downloads the script during parsing the document but will pause the parser to execute the script before it has fully finished parsing. `async` scripts will not necessarily execute in order.
Note: both attributes must only be used if the script has a `src` attribute (i.e. not an inline script).
``` {.sourceCode .html}
<script src="myscript.js"></script>
<script src="myscript.js" defer></script>
<script src="myscript.js" async></script>
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Placing a `defer` script in the `<head>` allows the browser to download the script while the page is still parsing, and is therefore a better option than placing the script before the end of the body.
-   If the scripts rely on each other, use `defer`.
-   If the script is independent, use `async`.
-   Use `defer` if the DOM must be ready and the contents are not placed within a `DOMContentLoaded` listener.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is an `async` function?
```js
async function foo() {
  ...
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
An `async` function is a function that allows you to pause the function's execution while it waits for (`await`s) a promise to resolve. It's an abstraction on top of the Promise API that makes asynchronous operations *look* like they're synchronous.
`async` functions automatically return a Promise object. Whatever you `return` from the `async` function will be the promise's *resolution*. If instead you `throw` from the body of an `async` function, that will be how your async function *rejects* the promise it returns.
Most importantly, `async` functions are able to use the `await` keyword in their function body, which **pauses the function** until the operation after the `await` completes, and allows it to return that operation's result to a variable synchronously.
```js
// Normal promises in regular function:
function foo() {
  promiseCall()
    .then(result => {
      // do something with the result
    })
}
// async functions
async function foo() {
  const result = await promiseCall()
  // do something with the result
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   `async` functions are just syntactic sugar on top of Promises.
-   They make asynchronous operations look like synchronous operations in your function.
-   They implicitly return a promise which resolves to whatever your `async` function returns, and reject to whatever your `async` function `throw`s.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Create a function `batches` that returns the maximum number of whole batches that can be cooked from a recipe.
```js
/**
It accepts two objects as arguments: the first object is the recipe
for the food, while the second object is the available ingredients.
Each ingredient's value is a number representing how many units there are.
`batches(recipe, available)`
*/
// 0 batches can be made
batches(
  { milk: 100, butter: 50, flour: 5 },
  { milk: 132, butter: 48, flour: 51 }
)
batches(
  { milk: 100, flour: 4, sugar: 10, butter: 5 },
  { milk: 1288, flour: 9, sugar: 95 }
)
// 1 batch can be made
batches(
  { milk: 100, butter: 50, cheese: 10 },
  { milk: 198, butter: 52, cheese: 10 }
)
// 2 batches can be made
batches(
  { milk: 2, sugar: 40, butter: 20 },
  { milk: 5, sugar: 120, butter: 500 }
)
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
We must have all ingredients of the recipe available, and in quantities that are more than or equal to the number of units required. If just one of the ingredients is not available or lower than needed, we cannot make a single batch.
Use `Object.keys()` to return the ingredients of the recipe as an array, then use `Array.prototype.map()` to map each ingredient to the ratio of available units to the amount required by the recipe. If one of the ingredients required by the recipe is not available at all, the ratio will evaluate to `NaN`, so the logical OR operator can be used to fallback to `0` in this case.
Use the spread `...` operator to feed the array of all the ingredient ratios into `Math.min()` to determine the lowest ratio. Passing this entire result into `Math.floor()` rounds down to return the maximum number of whole batches.
```js
const batches = (recipe, available) =>
  Math.floor(
    Math.min(...Object.keys(recipe).map(k => available[k] / recipe[k] || 0))
  )

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is CSS BEM?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The BEM methodology is a naming convention for CSS classes in order to keep CSS more maintainable by defining namespaces to solve scoping issues. BEM stands for Block Element Modifier which is an explanation for its structure. A Block is a standalone component that is reusable across projects and acts as a "namespace" for sub components (Elements). Modifiers are used as flags when a Block or Element is in a certain state or is different in structure or style.
``` {.sourceCode .css}
/* block component */
.block {
}
/* element */
.block__element {
}
/* modifier */
.block__element--modifier {
}
```
Here is an example with the class names on markup:
``` {.sourceCode .html}
<nav class="navbar">
  <a href="/" class="navbar__link navbar__link--active"></a>
  <a href="/" class="navbar__link"></a>
  <a href="/" class="navbar__link"></a>
</nav>
```
In this case, `navbar` is the Block, `navbar__link` is an Element that makes no sense outside of the `navbar` component, and `navbar__link--active` is a Modifier that indicates a different state for the `navbar__link` Element.
Since Modifiers are verbose, many opt to use `is-*` flags instead as modifiers.
``` {.sourceCode .html}
<a href="/" class="navbar__link is-active"></a>
```
These must be chained to the Element and never alone however, or there will be scope issues.
``` {.sourceCode .css}
.navbar__link.is-active {
}
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is Big O Notation?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. The best algorithms will execute the fastest and have the simplest complexity.
Algorithms don't always perform the same and may vary based on the data they are supplied. While in some cases they will execute quickly, in other cases they will execute slowly, even with the same number of elements to deal with.
In these examples, the base time is 1 element = `1ms`.
###   <span style="color:red;"> O(1)
```js
arr[arr.length - 1]
```
-   1000 elements = `1ms`
Constant time complexity. No matter how many elements the array has, it will theoretically take (excluding real-world variation) the same amount of time to execute.
###   <span style="color:red;"> O(N)
```js
arr.filter(fn)
```
-   1000 elements = `1000ms`
Linear time complexity. The execution time will increase linearly with the number of elements the array has. If the array has 1000 elements and the function takes 1ms to execute, 7000 elements will take 7ms to execute. This is because the function must iterate through all elements of the array before returning a result.
###   <span style="color:red;"> O([1, N])
```js
arr.some(fn)
```
-   1000 elements = `1ms <= x <= 1000ms`
The execution time varies depending on the data supplied to the function, it may return very early or very late. The best case here is O(1) and the worst case is O(N).
###   <span style="color:red;"> O(NlogN)
```js
arr.sort(fn)
```
-   1000 elements \~= `10000ms`
Browsers usually implement the quicksort algorithm for the `sort()` method and the average time complexity of quicksort is O(NlgN). This is very efficient for large collections.
###   <span style="color:red;"> O(N\^2)
```js
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
    // ...
  }
}
```
-   1000 elements = `1000000ms`
The execution time rises quadratically with the number of elements. Usually the result of nesting loops.
###   <span style="color:red;"> O(N!)
```js
const permutations = arr => {
  if (arr.length <= 2) return arr.length === 2 ? [arr, [arr[1], arr[0]]] : arr
  return arr.reduce(
    (acc, item, i) =>
      acc.concat(
        permutations([...arr.slice(0, i), ...arr.slice(i + 1)]).map(val => [
          item,
          ...val
        ])
      ),
    []
  )
}
```
-   1000 elements = `Infinity` (practically) ms
The execution time rises extremely fast with even just 1 addition to the array.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Be wary of nesting loops as execution time increases exponentially.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the purpose of cache busting and how can you achieve it?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Browsers have a cache to temporarily store files on websites so they don't need to be re-downloaded again when switching between pages or reloading the same page. The server is set up to send headers that tell the browser to store the file for a given amount of time. This greatly increases website speed and preserves bandwidth.
However, it can cause problems when the website has been changed by developers because the user's cache still references old files. This can either leave them with old functionality or break a website if the cached CSS and JavaScript files are referencing elements that no longer exist, have moved or have been renamed.
Cache busting is the process of forcing the browser to download the new files. This is done by naming the file something different to the old file.
A common technique to force the browser to re-download the file is to append a query string to the end of the file.
-   `src="js/script.js"` =\> `src="js/script.js?v=2"`
The browser considers it a different file but prevents the need to change the file name.

###   <span style="color:red;"> How can you avoid callback hells?
```js

  getMoreData(a, function(b) {
    getMoreData(b, function(c) {
      getMoreData(c, function(d) {
        getMoreData(d, function(e) {
          // ...
        })
      })
    })
  })
})
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Refactoring the functions to return promises and using `async/await` is usually the best option. Instead of supplying the functions with callbacks that cause deep nesting, they return a promise that can be `await`ed and will be resolved once the data has arrived, allowing the next line of code to be evaluated in a sync-like fashion.
The above code can be restructured like so:
```js
async function asyncAwaitVersion() {
  const a = await getData()
  const b = await getMoreData(a)
  const c = await getMoreData(b)
  const d = await getMoreData(c)
  const e = await getMoreData(d)
  // ...
}
```
There are lots of ways to solve the issue of callback hells:
-   Modularization: break callbacks into independent functions
-   Use a control flow library, like async
-   Use generators with Promises
-   Use async/await (from v7 on)
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of `setState`?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The callback function is invoked when `setState` has finished and the component gets rendered. Since `setState` is asynchronous, the callback function is used for any post action.
```js
setState({ name: "sudheer" }, () => {
  console.log("The name has updated and component re-rendered")
})
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   The callback function is invoked after `setState` finishes and is used for any post action.
-   It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather this callback function.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Which is the preferred option between callback refs and findDOMNode()?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Callback refs are preferred over the `findDOMNode()` API, due to the fact that `findDOMNode()` prevents certain improvements in React in the future.
```js
// Legacy approach using findDOMNode()
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView()
  }
  render() {
    return <div />
  }
}
// Recommended approach using callback refs
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.node.scrollIntoView()
  }
  render() {
    return <div ref={node => (this.node = node)} />
  }
}
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a callback? Can you show an example using one?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Callbacks are functions passed as an argument to another function to be executed once an event has occurred or a certain task is complete, often used in asynchronous code. Callback functions are invoked later by a piece of code but can be declared on initialization without being invoked.
As an example, event listeners are asynchronous callbacks that are only executed when a specific event occurs.
```js
function onClick() {
  console.log("The user clicked on the page.")
}
document.addEventListener("click",
    onClick)
```
However, callbacks can also be synchronous. The following `map` function takes a callback function that is invoked synchronously for each iteration of the loop (array element).
```js
const map = (arr, callback) => {
  const result = []
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    result.push(callback(arr[i], i))
  }
  return result
}
map([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n => n * 2) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the `children` prop?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
`children` is part of the props object passed to components that allows components to be passed as data to other components, providing the ability to compose components cleanly. There are a number of methods available in the React API to work with this prop, such as `React.Children.map`, `React.Children.forEach`, `React.Children.count`, `React.Children.only` and `React.Children.toArray`. A simple usage example of the children prop is as follows:
```js
function GenericBox({ children }) {
  return <div className="container">{children}</div>
}
function App() {
  return (
    <GenericBox>
      <span>Hello</span> <span>World</span>
    </GenericBox>
  )
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:

###   <span style="color:red;"> Why does React use `className` instead of `class` like in HTML?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
React's philosophy in the beginning was to align with the browser DOM API rather than HTML, since that more closely represents how elements are created. Setting a `class` on an element meant using the `className` API:
```js
const element = document.createElement("div")
element.className = "hello"
```
Additionally, before ES5, reserved words could not be used in objects:
```js
const element = {
  attributes: {
    class: "hello"
  }
}
```
In IE8, this will throw an error.
In modern environments, destructuring will throw an error if trying to assign to a variable:
```js
const { class } = this.props // Error
const { className } = this.props // All good
const { class: className } =
    this.props // All good, but
        cumbersome!
```
However, `class` *can* be used as a prop without problems, as seen in other libraries like Preact. React currently allows you to use `class`, but will throw a warning and convert it to `className` under the hood. There is currently an open thread (as of January 2019) discussing changing `className` to `class` to reduce confusion.

###   <span style="color:red;"> How do you clone an object in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Using the object spread operator `...`, the object's own enumerable properties can be copied into the new object. This creates a shallow clone of the object.
```js
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 }
const shallowClone = { ...obj }
```
With this technique, prototypes are ignored. In addition, nested objects are not cloned, but rather their references get copied, so nested objects still refer to the same objects as the original. Deep-cloning is much more complex in order to effectively clone any type of object (Date, RegExp, Function, Set, etc) that may be nested within the object.
Other alternatives include:
-   `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` can be used to deep-clone a simple object, but it is CPU-intensive and only accepts valid JSON (therefore it strips functions and does not allow circular references).
-   `Object.assign({}, obj)` is another alternative.
-   `Object.keys(obj).reduce((acc, key) => (acc[key] = obj[key], acc), {})` is another more verbose alternative that shows the concept in greater depth.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   JavaScript passes objects by reference, meaning that nested objects get their references copied, instead of their values.
-   The same method can be used to merge two objects.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a closure? Can you give a useful example of one?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A closure is a function defined inside another function and has access to its lexical scope even when it is executing outside its lexical scope. The closure has access to variables in three scopes:
-   Variables declared in its own scope
-   Variables declared in the scope of the parent function
-   Variables declared in the global scope
In JavaScript, all functions are closures because they have access to the outer scope, but most functions don't utilise the usefulness of closures: the persistence of state. Closures are also sometimes called stateful functions because of this.
In addition, closures are the only way to store private data that can't be accessed from the outside in JavaScript. They are the key to the UMD (Universal Module Definition) pattern, which is frequently used in libraries that only expose a public API but keep the implementation details private, preventing name collisions with other libraries or the user's own code.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Closures are useful because they let you associate data with a function that operates on that data.
-   A closure can substitute an object with only a single method.
-   Closures can be used to emulate private properties and methods.

###   <span style="color:red;"> How do you compare two objects in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Even though two different objects can have the same properties with equal values, they are not considered equal when compared using `==` or `===`. This is because they are being compared by their reference (location in memory), unlike primitive values which are compared by value.
In order to test if two objects are equal in structure, a helper function is required. It will iterate through the own properties of each object to test if they have the same values, including nested objects. Optionally, the prototypes of the objects may also be tested for equivalence by passing `true` as the 3rd argument.
Note: this technique does not attempt to test equivalence of data structures other than plain objects, arrays, functions, dates and primitive values.
```js
function isDeepEqual(obj1, obj2, testPrototypes = false) {
  if (obj1 === obj2) {
    return true
  }
  if (typeof obj1 === "function" && typeof obj2 === "function") {
    return obj1.toString() === obj2.toString()
  }
  if (obj1 instanceof Date && obj2 instanceof Date) {
    return obj1.getTime() === obj2.getTime()
  }
  if (
    Object.prototype.toString.call(obj1) !==
      Object.prototype.toString.call(obj2) ||
    typeof obj1 !== "object"
  ) {
    return false
  }
  const prototypesAreEqual = testPrototypes
    ? isDeepEqual(
        Object.getPrototypeOf(obj1),
        Object.getPrototypeOf(obj2),
        true
      )
    : true
  const obj1Props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1)
  const obj2Props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2)
  return (
    obj1Props.length === obj2Props.length &&
    prototypesAreEqual &&
    obj1Props.every(prop => isDeepEqual(obj1[prop], obj2[prop]))
  )
}
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is context?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. For example, authenticated user, locale preference, UI theme need to be accessed in the application by many components.
```js
const { Provider, Consumer } = React.createContext(defaultValue)
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Context provides a way to pass data through a tree of React components, without having to manually pass props.
-   Context is designed to share data that is considered *global* for a tree of React components.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is CORS?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or CORS is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to grant a browser permission to access resources from a server at an origin different from the website origin.
An example of a cross-origin request is a web application served from `http://mydomain.com` that uses AJAX to make a request for `http://yourdomain.com`.
For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated by JavaScript. `XMLHttpRequest` and `fetch` follow the same-origin policy, meaning a web application using those APIs can only request HTTP resources from the same origin the application was accessed, unless the response from the other origin includes the correct CORS headers.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   CORS behavior is not an error,  it's a security mechanism to protect users.
-   CORS is designed to prevent a malicious website that a user may unintentionally visit from making a request to a legitimate website to read their personal data or perform actions against their will.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Describe the layout of the CSS Box Model and briefly describe each component.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
`Content`: The inner-most part of the box filled with content, such as text, an image, or video player. It has the dimensions `content-box width` and `content-box height`.
`Padding`: The transparent area surrounding the content. It has dimensions `padding-box width` and `padding-box height`.
`Border`: The area surrounding the padding (if any) and content. It has dimensions `border-box width` and `border-box height`.
*Margin*: The transparent outer-most layer that surrounds the border. It separates the element from other elements in the DOM. It has dimensions `margin-box width` and `margin-box height`.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are the advantages of using CSS preprocessors?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
CSS preprocessors add useful functionality that native CSS does not have, and generally make CSS neater and more maintainable by enabling DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles. Their terse syntax for nested selectors cuts down on repeated code. They provide variables for consistent theming (however, CSS variables have largely replaced this functionality) and additional tools like color functions (`lighten`, `darken`, `transparentize`, etc), mixins, and loops that make CSS more like a real programming language and gives the developer more power to generate complex CSS.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between '+' and '\~' sibling selectors?.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The General Sibling Selector `~` selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.
The following example selects all `<p>` elements that are siblings of `<div>` elements:
``` {.sourceCode .css}
div ~ p {
  background-color: blue;
}
```
The Adjacent Sibling Selector `+` selects all elements that are the adjacent siblings of a specified element.
The following example will select all `<p>` elements that are placed immediately after `<div>` elements:
``` {.sourceCode .css}
div + p {
  background-color: red;
}
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> Can you describe how CSS specificity works?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Assuming the browser has already determined the set of rules for an element, each rule is assigned a matrix of values, which correspond to the following from highest to lowest specificity:
-   Inline rules (binary - 1 or 0)
-   Number of id selectors
-   Number of class, pseudo-class and attribute selectors
-   Number of tags and pseudo-element selectors
When two selectors are compared, the comparison is made on a per-column basis (e.g. an id selector will always be higher than any amount of class selectors, as ids have higher specificity than classes). In cases of equal specificity between multiple rules, the rules that comes last in the page's style sheet is deemed more specific and therefore applied to the element.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is debouncing?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Debouncing is a process to add some delay before executing a function. It is commonly used with DOM event listeners to improve the performance of page. It is a technique which allow us to "group" multiple sequential calls in a single one. A raw DOM event listeners can easily trigger 20+ events per second. A debounced function will only be called once the delay has passed.
```js
const debounce = (func, delay) => { 
  let debounceTimer;
  return function() { 
    const context = this;
    const args = arguments; 
      clearTimeout(debounceTimer); 
        debounceTimer = setTimeout(() => func.apply(context, args), delay);
  }
}
window.addEventListere('scroll', debounce(function() {
  // Do stuff, this function will be called after a delay of 1 second
}, 1000));
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the DOM?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a cross-platform API that treats HTML and XML documents as a tree structure consisting of nodes. These nodes (such as elements and text nodes) are objects that can be programmatically manipulated and any visible changes made to them are reflected live in the document. In a browser, this API is available to JavaScript where DOM nodes can be manipulated to change their styles, contents, placement in the document, or interacted with through event listeners.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API.
-   The DOM is constructed progressively in the browser as a page loads, which is why scripts are often placed at the bottom of a page, in the `<head>` with a `defer` attribute, or inside a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener. Scripts that manipulate DOM nodes should be run after the DOM has been constructed to avoid errors.
-   `document.getElementById()` and `document.querySelector()` are common functions for selecting DOM nodes.
-   Setting the `innerHTML` property to a new value runs the string through the HTML parser, offering an easy way to append dynamic HTML content to a node.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between the equality operators `==` and `===`?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Triple equals (`===`) checks for strict equality, which means both the type and value must be the same. Double equals (`==`) on the other hand first performs type coercion so that both operands are of the same type and then applies strict comparison.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Whenever possible, use triple equals to test equality because loose equality `==` can have unintuitive results.
-   Type coercion means the values are converted into the same type.
-   Mention of falsy values and their comparison.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between an element and a component in React?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
An element is a plain JavaScript object that represents a DOM node or component. Elements are pure and never mutated, and are cheap to create.
A component is a function or class. Components can have state and take props as input and return an element tree as output (although they can represent generic containers or wrappers and don't necessarily have to emit DOM). Components can initiate side effects in lifecycle methods (e.g. AJAX requests, DOM mutations, interfacing with 3rd party libraries) and may be expensive to create.
```js
const Component = () => "Hello"
const componentElement = <Component />
const domNodeElement = <div />
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Elements are immutable, plain objects that describe the DOM nodes or components you want to render.
-   Components can be either classes or functions, that take props as an input and return an element tree as the output.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between `em` and `rem` units?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Both `em` and `rem` units are based on the `font-size` CSS property. The only difference is where they inherit their values from.
-   `em` units inherit their value from the `font-size` of the parent element
-   `rem` units inherit their value from the `font-size` of the root element (`html`)
In most browsers, the `font-size` of the root element is set to `16px` by default.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are error boundaries in React?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.
Class components become error boundaries if they define either (or both) of the lifecycle methods `static getDerivedStateFromError()` or `componentDidCatch().`
```js
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { hasError: false }
  }
  // Use componentDidCatch to log the error
  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    logErrorToMyService(error, info)
  }
  // use getDerivedStateFromError to update state
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Display fallback UI
     return { hasError: true };
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>
    }
    return this.props.children
  }
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Error boundaries only catch errors in the components below them in the tree. An error boundary can't catch an error within itself.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is event delegation and why is it useful? Can you show an example of how to use it?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Event delegation is a technique of delegating events to a single common ancestor. Due to event bubbling, events "bubble" up the DOM tree by executing any handlers progressively on each ancestor element up to the root that may be listening to it.
DOM events provide useful information about the element that initiated the event via `Event.target`. This allows the parent element to handle behavior as though the target element was listening to the event, rather than all children of the parent or the parent itself.
This provides two main benefits:
-   It increases performance and reduces memory consumption by only needing to register a single event listener to handle potentially thousands of elements.
-   If elements are dynamically added to the parent, there is no need to register new event listeners for them.
Instead of:
```js
document.querySelectorAll("button").forEach(button => {
  button.addEventListener("click", handleButtonClick)
})
```
Event delegation involves using a condition to ensure the child target matches our desired element:
```js
document.addEventListener("click", e => {
  if (e.target.closest("button")) {
    handleButtonClick()
  }
})
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is event-driven programming?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Event-driven programming is a paradigm that involves building applications that send and receive events. When the program emits events, the program responds by running any callback functions that are registered to that event and context, passing in associated data to the function. With this pattern, events can be emitted into the wild without throwing errors even if no functions are subscribed to it.
A common example of this is the pattern of elements listening to DOM events such as `click` and `mouseenter`, where a callback function is run when the event occurs.
```js
document.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  // This callback function is run when the user
  // clicks on the document.
})
```
Without the context of the DOM, the pattern may look like this:
```js
const hub = createEventHub()
hub.on("message", function(data) {
  console.log(`${data.username} said ${data.text}`)
})
hub.emit("message", {
  username: "John",
  text: "Hello?"
})
```
With this implementation, `on` is the way to *subscribe* to an event, while `emit` is the way to *publish* the event.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between an expression and a statement in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
There are two main syntactic categories in JavaScript: expressions and statements. A third one is both together, referred to as an expression statement. They are roughly summarized as:
-   **Expression**: produces a value
-   **Statement**: performs an action
-   **Expression statement**: produces a value and performs an action
A general rule of thumb:
> If you can print it or assign it to a variable, it's an expression. If you can't, it's a statement.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Statements
```js
let x = 0
function declaration() {}
if (true) {
}
```
Statements appear as instructions that do something but don't produce values.
```js
// Assign `x` to the absolute value of `y`.
var x
if (y >= 0) {
  x = y
} else {
  x = -y
}
```
The only expression in the above code is `y >= 0` which produces a value, either `true` or `false`. A value is not produced by other parts of the code.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Expressions
Expressions produce a value. They can be passed around to functions because the interpreter replaces them with the value they resolve to.
```js
5 + 5 // => 10
lastCharacter("input") // => "t"
true === true // => true
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Expression statements
There is an equivalent version of the set of statements used before as an expression using the conditional operator:
```js
// Assign `x` as the absolute value of `y`.
var x = y >= 0 ? y : -y
```
This is both an expression and a statement, because we are declaring a variable `x` (statement) as an evaluation (expression).

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are truthy and falsy values in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A value is either truthy or falsy depending on how it is evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy means false-like and truthy means true-like. Essentially, they are values that are coerced to `true` or `false` when performing certain operations.
There are 6 falsy values in JavaScript. They are:
-   `false`
-   `undefined`
-   `null`
-   `""` (empty string)
-   `NaN`
-   `0` (both `+0` and `-0`)
Every other value is considered truthy.
A value's truthiness can be examined by passing it into the `Boolean` function.
```js
Boolean("") // false
Boolean([]) // true
```
There is a shortcut for this using the logical NOT `!` operator. Using `!` once will convert a value to its inverse boolean equivalent (i.e. not false is true), and `!` once more will convert back, thus effectively converting the value to a boolean.
```js
!!"" // false
!![] // true
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> Using flexbox, create a 3-column layout where each column takes up a `col-{n} / 12` ratio of the container.
``` {.sourceCode .html}
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-2"></div>
  <div class="col-7"></div>
  <div class="col-3"></div>
</div>
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Set the `.row` parent to `display: flex;` and use the `flex` shorthand property to give the column classes a `flex-grow` value that corresponds to its ratio value.
``` {.sourceCode .css}
.row {
  display: flex;
}
.col-2 {
  flex: 2;
}
.col-7 {
  flex: 7;
}
.col-3 {

###   <span style="color:red;"> What does `0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3` evaluate to?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
It evaluates to `false` because JavaScript uses the IEEE 754 standard for Math and it makes use of 64-bit floating numbers. This causes precision errors when doing decimal calculations, in short, due to computers working in Base 2 while decimal is Base 10.
```js
0.1 + 0.2 // 0.30000000000000004
```
A solution to this problem would be to use a function that determines if two numbers are approximately equal by defining an error margin (epsilon) value that the difference between two values should be less than.
```js
const approxEqual = (n1, n2, epsilon = 0.0001) => Math.abs(n1 - n2) < epsilon
approxEqual(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3) // true
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a focus ring? What is the correct solution to handle them?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A focus ring is a visible outline given to focusable elements such as buttons and anchor tags. It varies depending on the vendor, but generally it appears as a blue outline around the element to indicate it is currently focused.
In the past, many people specified `outline: 0;` on the element to remove the focus ring. However, this causes accessibility issues for keyboard users because the focus state may not be clear. When not specified though, it causes an unappealing blue ring to appear around an element.
In recent times, frameworks like Bootstrap have opted to use a more appealing `box-shadow` outline to replace the default focus ring. However, this is still not ideal for mouse users.
The best solution is an upcoming pseudo-selector `:focus-visible` which can be polyfilled today with JavaScript. It will only show a focus ring if the user is using a keyboard and leave it hidden for mouse users. This keeps both aesthetics for mouse use and accessibility for keyboard use.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between the array methods `map()` and `forEach()`?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Both methods iterate through the elements of an array. `map()` maps each element to a new element by invoking the callback function on each element and returning a new array. On the other hand, `forEach()` invokes the callback function for each element but does not return a new array. `forEach()` is generally used when causing a side effect on each iteration, whereas `map()` is a common functional programming technique.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Use `forEach()` if you need to iterate over an array and cause mutations to the elements without needing to return values to generate a new array.
-   `map()` is the right choice to keep data immutable where each value of the original array is mapped to a new array.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are fragments?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Fragments allow a React component to return multiple elements without a wrapper, by grouping the children without adding extra elements to the DOM. Fragments offer better performance, lower memory usage, a cleaner DOM and can help in dealing with certain CSS mechanisms (e.g. tables, Flexbox and Grid).
```js
render() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <ChildA />
      <ChildB />
      <ChildC />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
// Short syntax supported by Babel 7
render() {
  return (
    <>
      <ChildA />
      <ChildB />
      <ChildC />
    </>
  );
}
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is functional programming?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Functional programming is a paradigm in which programs are built in a declarative manner using pure functions that avoid shared state and mutable data. Functions that always return the same value for the same input and don't produce side effects are the pillar of functional programming. Many programmers consider this to be the best approach to software development as it reduces bugs and cognitive load.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Cleaner, more concise development experience
-   Simple function composition
-   Features of JavaScript that enable functional programming (`.map`, `.reduce` etc.)
-   JavaScript is multi-paradigm programming language (Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming live in harmony)

###   <span style="color:red;"> Describe your thoughts on how a single page web app should handle focus when changing routes
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Single page applications make use of client-side rendering. This means that 'examplesite.com' and 'examplesite.com/page2' are actually the same HTML web page, but the client app decides what content to drop into that single page at runtime. Your user never actually "leaves" the page, and this causes some accessibility issues in terms of focus.
Unless focus is explicitly managed in the app, a scenario like this may happen:
1.  User visits 'examplesite.com'
2.  User clicks a link to go to another route: 'examplesite.com/product1'
3.  Client app changes the visible content to show the details for this new route (e.g. some info about Product 1)
4.  Focus is still on the link that was clicked in step 2
5.  If a user uses the keyboard or screen reader to now try and read the content, the focused starting point is in the middle of the page on an element no longer visible
Many strategies have been proposed in handling this situation, all involving explicitly managing the focus when the new page content is rendered. [Recent research by GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-07-11-user-testing-accessible-client-routing/) suggests the best approach is:
1.  User visits 'examplesite.com'
2.  User clicks a link to go to another route: 'examplesite.com/product1'
3.  Client app changes the visible content to show the details for this new route (e.g. some info about Product 1)
4.  Client app manually places focus on the main header at the top of the page (almost always this will be the H1 element)
By doing so, focus is reset to the top of the page, ready for the user to begin exploring the new content. This solution requires inserting the main heading into the start of tabbing order with `tabindex="-1"`.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Focus issues caused by client-side rendering, instead of server-side
-   Focus should not be left on elements no longer visible on the page
-   Challenges faced by screen reader users and users utilising keyboard navigation
-   Careful manual focus management required

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are higher-order components?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component. It is a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature. Higher-order components are like **pure components** because they accept any dynamically provided child component, but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.
```js
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent)
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:

###   <span style="color:red;"> What will the console log in this example?
```js
var foo = 1
var foobar = function() {
  console.log(foo)
  var foo = 2
}
foobar()
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Due to hoisting, the local variable `foo` is declared before the `console.log` method is called. This means the local variable `foo` is passed as an argument to `console.log()` instead of the global one declared outside of the function. However, since the value is not hoisted with the variable declaration, the output will be `undefined`, not `2`.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:

###   <span style="color:red;"> Additional links
-   [MDN docs for hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)
###   <span style="color:red;"> How does hoisting work in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are put into memory during the compile phase. This means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.
However, the value is not hoisted with the declaration.
The following snippet:
```js
console.log(hoist)
var hoist = "value"
```
is equivalent to:
```js
var hoist
console.log(hoist)
hoist = "value"
```
Therefore logging `hoist` outputs `undefined` to the console, not `"value"`.
Hoisting also allows you to invoke a function declaration before it appears to be declared in a program.
```js
myFunction() // No error; logs "hello"
function myFunction() {
  console.log("hello")
}
```
But be wary of function expressions that are assigned to a variable:
```js
myFunction() // Error: `myFunction` is not a function
var myFunction = function() {
  console.log("hello")
}
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> Can a web page contain multiple `<header>` elements? What about `<footer>` elements?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Yes to both. The W3 documents state that the tags represent the header(`<header>`) and footer(`<footer>`) areas of their nearest ancestor "section". So not only can the page `<body>` contain a header and a footer, but so can every `<article>` and `<section>` element.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:

###   <span style="color:red;"> Discuss the differences between an HTML specification and a browser's implementation thereof.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
HTML specifications such as `HTML5` define a set of rules that a document must adhere to in order to be "valid" according to that specification. In addition, a specification provides instructions on how a browser must interpret and render such a document.
A browser is said to "support" a specification if it handles valid documents according to the rules of the specification. As of yet, no browser supports all aspects of the `HTML5` specification (although all of the major browser support most of it), and as a result, it is necessary for the developer to confirm whether the aspect they are making use of will be supported by all of the browsers on which they hope to display their content. This is why cross-browser support continues to be a headache for developers, despite the improved specificiations.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   `HTML5` defines some rules to follow for an invalid `HTML5` document (i.e., one that contains syntactical errors)
-   However, invalid documents may contain anything, so it's impossible for the specification to handle all possibilities comprehensively.
-   Thus, many decisions about how to handle malformed documents are left up to the browser.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
In HTML, the attribute name is in all lowercase and is given a string invoking a function defined somewhere:
``` {.sourceCode .html}
<button onclick="handleClick()"></button>
```
In React, the attribute name is camelCase and are passed the function reference inside curly braces:
```js
<button onClick={handleClick} />
```
In HTML, `false` can be returned to prevent default behavior, whereas in React `preventDefault` has to be called explicitly.
``` {.sourceCode .html}
<a href="#" onclick="console.log('The link was clicked.'); return false" />
```
```js
function handleClick(e) {
  e.preventDefault()
  console.log("The link was clicked.")
}

###   <span style="color:red;"> Briefly describe the correct usage of the following HTML5 semantic elements: `<header>`, `<article>`,`<section>`, `<footer>`
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer

-   `<article>` is meant to house a self-contained composition that can logically be independently recreated outside of the page without losing its meaning. Individual blog posts or news stories are good examples.
-   `<section>` is a flexible container for holding content that shares a common informational theme or purpose.
-   `<footer>` is used to hold information that should appear at the end of a section of content and contain additional information about the section. Author's name, copyright information, and related links are typical examples of such content.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is HTML5 Web Storage? Explain `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
With HTML5, web pages can store data locally within the user's browser. The data is stored in name/value pairs, and a web page can only access data stored by itself.
**Differences between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` regarding lifetime:**
-   Data stored through `localStorage` is permanent: it does not expire and remains stored on the user's computer until a web app deletes it or the user asks the browser to delete it.
-   `sessionStorage` has the same lifetime as the top-level window or browser tab in which the data got stored. When the tab is permanently closed, any data stored through `sessionStorage` is deleted.
**Differences between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` regarding storage scope:** Both forms of storage are scoped to the document origin so that documents with different origins will never share the stored objects.
-   `sessionStorage` is also scoped on a per-window basis. Two browser tabs with documents from the same origin have separate `sessionStorage` data.
-   Unlike in `localStorage`, the same scripts from the same origin can't access each other's `sessionStorage` when opened in different tabs.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Earlier, this was done with cookies.
-   The storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) than with cookies and its faster.
-   The data is never transferred to the server and can only be used if the client specifically asks for it.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the reason for wrapping the entire contents of a JavaScript source file in a function that is immediately invoked?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
This technique is very common in JavaScript libraries. It creates a closure around the entire contents of the file which creates a private namespace and thereby helps avoid potential name clashes between different JavaScript modules and libraries. The function is immediately invoked so that the namespace (library name) is assigned the return value of the function.
```js
const myLibrary = (function() {
  var privateVariable = 2
  return {
    publicMethod: () => privateVariable
  }
})()
privateVariable // ReferenceError
myLibrary.publicMethod() // 2

###   <span style="color:red;"> Explain the differences between imperative and declarative programming.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
These two types of programming can roughly be summarized as:
-   Imperative: **how** to achieve something
-   Declarative: **what** should be achieved
A common example of declarative programming is CSS. The developer specifies CSS properties that describe what something should look like rather than how to achieve it. The "how" is abstracted away by the browser.
On the other hand, imperative programming involves the steps required to achieve something. In JavaScript, the differences can be contrasted like so:
###   <span style="color:red;"> Imperative
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const numbersDoubled = []
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  numbersDoubled[i] = numbers[i] * 2
}
```
We manually loop over the numbers of the array and assign the new index as the number doubled.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Declarative
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const numbersDoubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2)
```
We declare that the new array is mapped to a new one where each value is doubled.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Declarative programming often works with functions and expressions. Imperative programming frequently uses statements and relies on low-level features that cause mutations, while declarative programming has a strong focus on abstraction and purity.
-   Declarative programming is more terse and easier to process at a glance.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are inline conditional expressions?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Since a JSX element tree is one large expression, you cannot embed statements inside. Conditional expressions act as a replacement for statements to use inside the tree.
For example, this won't work:
```js
function App({ messages, isVisible }) {
  return (
    <div>
      if (messages.length > 0) {
        <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>
      } else {
        <h2>You have no unread messages.</h2>
      }
      if (isVisible) {
        <p>I am visible.</p>
      }
    </div>
  )
}
```
Logical AND `&&` and the ternary `? :` operator replace the `if`/`else` statements.
```js
function App({ messages, isVisible }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {messages.length > 0 ? (
        <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>
      ) : (
        <h2>You have no unread messages.</h2>
      )}
      {isVisible && <p>I am visible.</p>}
    </div>
  )
}

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a key? What are the benefits of using it in lists?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Keys are a special string attribute that helps React identify which items have been changed, added or removed. They are used when rendering array elements to give them a stable identity. Each element's key must be unique (e.g. IDs from the data or indexes as a last resort).
```js
const todoItems = todos.map(todo => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>)
```
-   Using indexes as keys is not recommended if the order of items may change, as it might negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.
-   If you extract list items as a separate component then apply keys on the list component instead of the `<li>` tag.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Keys give elements in a collection a stable identity and help React identify changes.
-   You should avoid using indexes as keys if the order of items may change.
-   You should lift the key up to the component, instead of the `<li>` element, if you extract list items as components.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between lexical scoping and dynamic scoping?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Lexical scoping refers to when the location of a function's definition determines which variables you have access to. On the other hand, dynamic scoping uses the location of the function's invocation to determine which variables are available.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Lexical scoping is also known as static scoping.
-   Lexical scoping in JavaScript allows for the concept of closures.
-   Most languages use lexical scoping because it tends to promote source code that is more easily understood.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are the lifecycle methods in React?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
`getDerivedStateFromProps`: Executed before rendering on the initial mount and all component updates. Used to update the state based on changes in props over time. Has rare use cases, like tracking component animations during the lifecycle. There are only few cases where this makes sense to use over other lifecycle methods. It expects to return an object that will be the the new state, or null to update nothing. This method does not have access to the component instance either.
`componentDidMount`: Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up eventListeners should occur.
`shouldComponentUpdate`: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default, it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return a false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a rerender if component receives new prop.
`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`: Invoked right after a component render happens because of an update, before `componentDidUpdate`. Any value returned from this method will be passed to `componentDidUpdate`.
`componentDidUpdate`: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
`componentWillUnmount`: It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.
`componentDidCatch`: Used in error boundaries, which are components that implement this method. It allows the component to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the *child* component tree (below this component), log errors, and display a UI with error information.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are the different phases of the component lifecycle in React?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
There are four different phases of component's lifecycle:
**Initialization**: In this phase, the component prepares setting up the initial state and default props.
**Mounting**: The react component is ready to mount to the DOM. This phase covers the `getDerivedStateFromProps` and `componentDidMount` lifecycle methods.
**Updating**: In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state. This phase covers the `getDerivedStateFromProps`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` and `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle methods.
**Unmounting**: In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes the `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method.
**Error Handling**: In this phase, the component is called whenever there's an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor for any child component. This phase includes the `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What does lifting state up in React mean?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
When several components need to share the same data, then it is recommended to lift the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. For example, if two child components share the same data, it is recommended to move the shared state to parent instead of maintaining the local state in both child components.

```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
> There are many ways to solve this problem, this is just one one of them.
Using `String.prototype.slice()` we can grab the last 4 characters of the string by passing `-4` as an argument. Then, using `String.prototype.padStart()`, we can pad the string to the original length with the repeated mask character.
```js
const mask = (str, maskChar = "#") =>
  str.slice(-4).padStart(str.length, maskChar)

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is memoization?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Memoization is the process of caching the output of function calls so that subsequent calls are faster. Calling the function again with the same input will return the cached output without needing to do the calculation again.
A basic implementation in JavaScript looks like this:
```js
const memoize = fn => {
  const cache = new Map()
  return value => {
    const cachedResult = cache.get(value)
    if (cachedResult !== undefined) return cachedResult
    const result = fn(value)
    cache.set(value, result)
    return result
  }
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   The above technique returns a unary function even if the function can take multiple arguments.
-   The first function call will be slower than usual because of the overhead created by checking if a cached result exists and setting a result before returning the value.
-   Memoization increases performance on subsequent function calls but still needs to do work on the first call.

###   <span style="color:red;"> How do you ensure methods have the correct `this` context in React component classes?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. This means that their `this` context can be changed (in the case of an event handler, to the element that is listening to the event) and will not refer to the component instance. To solve this, `Function.prototype.bind()` can be used to enforce the `this` context as the component instance.
```js
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
}
handleClick() {
  // Perform some logic
}
```
-   The `bind` approach can be verbose and requires defining a `constructor`, so the new public class fields syntax is generally preferred:
```js
handleClick = () => {
  console.log('this is:', this);
}
render() {
  return (
    <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
```
-   You can also use an inline arrow function, because lexical `this` (referring to the component instance) is preserved:
```js
<button onClick={e => this.handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>
```
Note that extra re-rendering can occur using this technique because a new function reference is created on render, which gets passed down to child components and breaks `shouldComponentUpdate` / `PureComponent` shallow equality checks to prevent unnecessary re-renders. In cases where performance is important, it is preferred to go with `bind` in the constructor, or the public class fields syntax approach, because the function reference remains constant.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   You can either bind methods to the component instance context in the constructor, use public class fields syntax, or use inline arrow functions.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a MIME type and what is it used for?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
`MIME` is an acronym for `Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions`. It is used as a standard way of classifying file types over the Internet.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   A `MIME type` actually has two parts: a type and a subtype that are separated by a slash (/). For example, the `MIME type` for Microsoft Word files is `application/msword` (i.e., type is application and the subtype is msword).

###   <span style="color:red;"> Contrast mutable and immutable values, and mutating vs non-mutating methods.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The two terms can be contrasted as:
-   Mutable: subject to change
-   Immutable: cannot change
In JavaScript, objects are mutable while primitive values are immutable. This means operations performed on objects can change the original reference in some way, while operations performed on a primitive value cannot change the original value.
All `String.prototype` methods do not have an effect on the original string and return a new string. On the other hand, while some methods of `Array.prototype` do not mutate the original array reference and produce a fresh array, some cause mutations.
```js
const myString = "hello!"
myString.replace("!", "") // returns a new string, cannot mutate the original value
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3]
originalArray.push(4) // mutates originalArray, now [1, 2, 3, 4]
originalArray.concat(4) // returns a new array, does not mutate the original
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the only value not equal to itself in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
`NaN` (Not-a-Number) is the only value not equal to itself when comparing with any of the comparison operators. `NaN` is often the result of meaningless math computations, so two `NaN` values make no sense to be considered equal.

###   <span style="color:red;"> NodeJS often uses a callback pattern where if an error is encountered during execution, this error is passed as the first argument to the callback. What are the advantages of this pattern?
```js
fs.readFile(filePath, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    // handle the error, the return is important here
    // so execution stops here
    return console.log(err)
  }
  // use the data object
  console.log(data)
})
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Advantages include:
-   Not needing to process data if there is no need to even reference it
-   Having a consistent API leads to more adoption
-   Ability to easily adapt a callback pattern that will lead to more maintainable code
As you can see from below example, the callback is called with null as its first argument if there is no error. However, if there is an error, you create an Error object, which then becomes the callback's only parameter. The callback function allows a user to easily know whether or not an error occurred.
This practice is also called the *Node.js error convention*, and this kind of callback implementations are called *error-first callbacks*.
```js
var isTrue = function(value, callback) {
  if (value === true) {
    callback(null, "Value was true.")
  } else {
    callback(new Error("Value is not true!"))
  }
}
var callback = function(error, retval) {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error)
    return
  }
  console.log(retval)
}
isTrue(false, callback)
isTrue(true, callback)
/*
  { stack: [Getter/Setter],
    arguments: undefined,
    type: undefined,
    message: 'Value is not true!' }
  Value was true.
*/
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
In JavaScript, two values discretely represent nothing - `undefined` and `null`. The concrete difference between them is that `null` is explicit, while `undefined` is implicit. When a property does not exist or a variable has not been given a value, the value is `undefined`. `null` is set as the value to explicitly indicate "no value". In essence, `undefined` is used when the nothing is not known, and `null` is used when the nothing is known.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   `typeof undefined` evaluates to `"undefined"`.
-   `typeof null` evaluates `"object"`. However, it is still a primitive value and this is considered an implementation bug in JavaScript.
-   `undefined == null` evaluates to `true`.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Describe the different ways to create an object. When should certain ways be preferred over others?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
###   <span style="color:red;"> Object literal
Often used to store one occurrence of data.
```js
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 50,
  birthday() {
    this.age++
  }
}
person.birthday() // person.age === 51
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Constructor
Often used when you need to create multiple instances of an object, each with their own data that other instances of the class cannot affect. The `new` operator must be used before invoking the constructor or the global object will be mutated.
```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name
  this.age = age
}
Person.prototype.birthday = function() {
  this.age++
}
const person1 = new Person("John", 50)
const person2 = new Person("Sally", 20)
person1.birthday() // person1.age === 51
person2.birthday() // person2.age === 21
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Factory function
Creates a new object similar to a constructor, but can store private data using a closure. There is also no need to use `new` before invoking the function or the `this` keyword. Factory functions usually discard the idea of prototypes and keep all properties and methods as own properties of the object.
```js
const createPerson = (name, age) => {
  const birthday = () => person.age++
  const person = { name, age, birthday }
  return person
}
const person = createPerson("John", 50)
person.birthday() // person.age === 51
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> `Object.create()`
Sets the prototype of the newly created object.
```js
const personProto = {
  birthday() {
    this.age++
  }
}
const person = Object.create(personProto)
person.age = 50
person.birthday() // person.age === 51
```
A second argument can also be supplied to `Object.create()` which acts as a descriptor for the new properties to be defined.
```js
Object.create(personProto, {
  age: {
    value: 50,
    writable: true,
    enumerable: true
  }
})
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Prototypes are objects that other objects inherit properties and methods from.
-   Factory functions offer private properties and methods through a closure but increase memory usage as a tradeoff, while classes do not have private properties or methods but reduce memory impact by reusing a single prototype object.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Parameters are the variable names of the function definition, while arguments are the values given to a function when it is invoked.
```js
function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2) {
  console.log(arguments[0]) // "argument1"
}
myFunction("argument1", "argument2")
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   `arguments` is an array-like object containing information about the arguments supplied to an invoked function.
-   `myFunction.length` describes the arity of a function (how many parameters it has, regardless of how many arguments it is supplied).

###   <span style="color:red;"> How do you pass an argument to an event handler or callback?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer

<button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)} />
```

const res = pipe(square, double, addOne)
res(3) // 19; addOne(double(square(3)))
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Gather all supplied arguments using the rest operator `...` and return a unary function that uses `Array.prototype.reduce()` to run the value through the series of functions before returning the final value.

###   <span style="color:red;"> In which states can a Promise be?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A `Promise` is in one of these states:
-   pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
-   fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
-   rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
A pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value, or rejected with a reason (error). When either of these options happens, the associated handlers queued up by a promise's then method are called.

###   <span style="color:red;"> How to apply prop validation in React?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
When the application is running in development mode, React will automatically check for all props that we set on components to make sure they are the correct data type. For incorrect data types, it will generate warning messages in the console for development mode. They are stripped in production mode due to their performance impact. Required props are defined with `isRequired`.
For example, we define `propTypes` for component as below:
```js
import PropTypes from "prop-types"
class User extends React.Component {
  static propTypes = {
    name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    age: PropTypes.number.isRequired
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Welcome, {this.props.name}</h1>
      <h2>Age, {this.props.age}
    )
  }
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   We can define custom `propTypes`
-   Using `propTypes` is not mandatory. However, it is a good practice and can reduce bugs.

###   <span style="color:red;"> How does prototypal inheritance differ from classical inheritance?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
In the classical inheritance paradigm, object instances inherit their properties and functions from a class, which acts as a blueprint for the object. Object instances are typically created using a constructor and the `new` keyword.
In the prototypal inheritance paradigm, object instances inherit directly from other objects and are typically created using factory functions or `Object.create()`.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a pure function?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A pure function is a function that satisfies these two conditions:
-   Given the same input, the function returns the same output.
-   The function doesn't cause side effects outside of the function's scope (i.e. mutate data outside the function or data supplied to the function).
Pure functions can mutate local data within the function as long as it satisfies the two conditions above.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Pure
```js
const a = (x, y) => x + y
const b = (arr, value) => arr.concat(value)
const c = arr => [...arr].sort((a, b) => a - b)
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Impure
```js
const a = (x, y) => x + y + Math.random()
const b = (arr, value) => (arr.push(value), arr)
const c = arr => arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Pure functions are easier to reason about due to their reliability.
-   All functions should be pure unless explicitly causing a side effect (i.e. `setInnerHTML`).
-   If a function does not return a value, it is an indication that it is causing side effects.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is recursion and when is it useful?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Recursion is the repeated application of a process. In JavaScript, recursion involves functions that call themselves repeatedly until they reach a base condition. The base condition breaks out of the recursion loop because otherwise the function would call itself indefinitely. Recursion is very useful when working with data structures that contain nesting where the number of levels deep is unknown.
For example, you may have a thread of comments returned from a database that exist in a flat array but need to be nested for display in the UI. Each comment is either a top-level comment (no parent) or is a reply to a parent comment. Comments can be a reply of a reply of a reply… we have no knowledge beforehand the number of levels deep a comment may be. This is where recursion can help.
```js
const nest = (items, id = null, link = "parent_id") =>
  items
    .filter(item => item[link] === id)
    .map(item => ({ ...item, children: nest(items, item.id) }))
const comments = [
  { id: 1, parent_id: null, text: "First reply to post." },
  { id: 2, parent_id: 1, text: "First reply to comment #1." },
  { id: 3, parent_id: 1, text: "Second reply to comment #1." },
  { id: 4, parent_id: 3, text: "First reply to comment #3." },
  { id: 5, parent_id: 4, text: "First reply to comment #4." },
  { id: 6, parent_id: null, text: "Second reply to post." }
]
nest(comments)
/*
[
  { id: 1, parent_id: null, text: "First reply to post.", children: [...] },
  { id: 6, parent_id: null, text: "Second reply to post.", children: [] }
]
*/
```
In the above example, the base condition is met if `filter()` returns an empty array. The chained `map()` won't invoke the callback function which contains the recursive call, thereby breaking the loop.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Recursion is useful when working with data structures containing an unknown number of nested structures.
-   Recursion must have a base condition to be met that breaks out of the loop or it will call itself indefinitely.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method. Refs should be used sparringly, but there are some good use cases for refs, such as:
-   Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
-   Triggering imperative animations.
-   Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.
Refs are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, assign the `ref` to the instance property within the constructor:
```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.myRef = React.createRef()
  }
  render() {
    return <div ref={this.myRef} />
  }
}
```
Refs can also be used in functional components with the help of closures.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Refs are used to return a reference to an element.
-   Refs shouldn't be overused.
-   You can create a ref using `React.createRef()` and attach to elements via the `ref` attribute.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Where and why is the `rel="noopener"` attribute used?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The `rel="noopener"` is an attribute used in `<a>` elements (hyperlinks). It prevents pages from having a `window.opener` property, which would otherwise point to the page from where the link was opened and would allow the page opened from the hyperlink to manipulate the page where the hyperlink is.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   `rel="noopener"` is applied to hyperlinks.
-   `rel="noopener"` prevents opened links from manipulating the source page.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is REST?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a software design pattern for network architecture. A RESTful web application exposes data in the form of information about its resources.
Generally, this concept is used in web applications to manage state. With most applications, there is a common theme of reading, creating, updating, and destroying data. Data is modularized into separate tables like `posts`, `users`, `comments`, and a RESTful API exposes access to this data with:
-   An identifier for the resource. This is known as the endpoint or URL for the resource.
-   The operation the server should perform on that resource in the form of an HTTP method or verb. The common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
Here is an example of the URL and HTTP method with a `posts` resource:
-   Reading: `/posts/` =\> GET
-   Creating: `/posts/new` =\> POST
-   Updating: `/posts/:id` =\> PUT
-   Destroying: `/posts/:id` =\> DELETE

###   <span style="color:red;"> What does the following function return?
```js
function greet() {
  return
  {
    message: "hello"
  }
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Because of JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion (ASI), the compiler places a semicolon after `return` keyword and therefore it returns `undefined` without an error being thrown.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Automatic semicolon placement can lead to time-consuming bugs

###   <span style="color:red;"> Are semicolons required in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Sometimes. Due to JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion, the interpreter places semicolons after most statements. This means semicolons can be omitted in most cases.
However, there are some cases where they are required. They are not required at the beginning of a block, but are if they follow a line and:
1.  The line starts with `[`
```js
const previousLine = 3
;[1, 2, previousLine].map(n => n * 2)
```
1.  The line starts with `(`
```js
const previousLine = 3
;(function() {
  // ...
})()
```
In the above cases, the interpreter does not insert a semicolon after `3`, and therefore it will see the `3` as attempting object property access or being invoked as a function, which will throw errors.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Semicolons are usually optional in JavaScript but have edge cases where they are required.
-   If you don't use semicolons, tools like Prettier will insert semicolons for you in the places where they are required on save in a text editor to prevent errors.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is short-circuit evaluation in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Short-circuit evaluation involves logical operations evaluating from left-to-right and stopping early.
```js
true || false
```
In the above sample using logical OR, JavaScript won't look at the second operand `false`, because the expression evaluates to `true` regardless. This is known as short-circuit evaluation.
This also works for logical AND.
```js
false && true
```
This means you can have an expression that throws an error if evaluated, and it won't cause issues.
```js
true || nonexistentFunction()
false && nonexistentFunction()
```
This remains true for multiple operations because of left-to-right evaluation.
```js
true || nonexistentFunction() || window.nothing.wouldThrowError
true || window.nothing.wouldThrowError
true
```
A common use case for this behavior is setting default values. If the first operand is falsy the second operand will be evaluated.
```js
const options = {}
const setting = options.setting || "default"
setting // "default"
```
Another common use case is only evaluating an expression if the first operand is truthy.
```js
// Instead of:
addEventListener("click", e => {
  if (e.target.closest("button")) {
    handleButtonClick(e)
  }
})
// You can take advantage of short-circuit evaluation:
addEventListener(
  "click",
  e => e.target.closest("button") && handleButtonClick(e)
)
```
In the above case, if `e.target` is not or does not contain an element matching the `"button"` selector, the function will not be called. This is because the first operand will be falsy, causing the second operand to not be evaluated.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Logical operations do not produce a boolean unless the operand(s) evaluate to a boolean.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are the advantages of using CSS sprites and how are they utilized?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
CSS sprites combine multiple images into one image, limiting the number of HTTP requests a browser has to make, thus improving load times. Even under the new HTTP/2 protocol, this remains true.
Under HTTP/1.1, at most one request is allowed per TCP connection. With HTTP/1.1, modern browsers open multiple parallel connections (between 2 to 8) but it is limited. With HTTP/2, all requests between the browser and the server are multiplexed on a single TCP connection. This means the cost of opening and closing multiple connections is mitigated, resulting in a better usage of the TCP connection and limits the impact of latency between the client and server. It could then become possible to load tens of images in parallel on the same TCP connection.
However, according to [benchmark results](https://blog.octo.com/en/http2-arrives-but-sprite-sets-aint-no-dead/), although HTTP/2 offers 50% improvement over HTTP/1.1, in most cases the sprite set is still faster to load than individual images.
To utilize a spritesheet in CSS, one would use certain properties, such as `background-image`, `background-position` and `background-size` to ultimately alter the `background` of an element.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a stateful component in React?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A stateful component is a component whose behavior depends on its state. This means that two separate instances of the component if given the same props will not necessarily render the same output, unlike pure function components.
```js
// Stateful class component
class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { count: 0 }
  }
  render() {
    // ...
  }
}
// Stateful function component
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return // ...
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Stateful components have internal state that they depend on.
-   Stateful components are class components or function components that use stateful Hooks.
-   Stateful components have their state initialized in the constructor or with `useState()`.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a stateless component?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A stateless component is a component whose behavior does not depend on its state. Stateless components can be either functional or class components. Stateless functional components are easier to maintain and test since they are guaranteed to produce the same output given the same props. Stateless functional components should be preferred when lifecycle hooks don't need to be used.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Stateless components are independent of their state.
-   Stateless components can be either class or functional components.
-   Stateless functional components avoid the `this` keyword altogether.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Explain the difference between a static method and an instance method.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Static methods belong to a class and don't act on instances, while instance methods belong to the class prototype which is inherited by all instances of the class and acts on them.
```js
Array.isArray // static method of Array
Array.prototype.push // instance method of Array
```
In this case, the `Array.isArray` method does not make sense as an instance method of arrays because we already know the value is an array when working with it.
Instance methods could technically work as static methods, but provide terser syntax:
```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3]
arr.push(4)
Array.push(arr, 4)
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Synchronous means each operation must wait for the previous one to complete.
Asynchronous means an operation can occur while another operation is still being processed.
In JavaScript, all code is synchronous due to the single-threaded nature of it. However, asynchronous operations not part of the program (such as `XMLHttpRequest` or `setTimeout`) are processed outside of the main thread because they are controlled by native code (browser APIs), but callbacks part of the program will still be executed synchronously.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   JavaScript has a concurrency model based on an "event loop".
-   Functions like `alert` block the main thread so that no user input is registered until the user closes it.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the `this` keyword and how does it work?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The `this` keyword is an object that represents the context of an executing function. Regular functions can have their `this` value changed with the methods `call()`, `apply()` and `bind()`. Arrow functions implicitly bind `this` so that it refers to the context of its lexical environment, regardless of whether or not its context is set explicitly with `call()`.
Here are some common examples of how `this` works:
###   <span style="color:red;"> Object literals
`this` refers to the object itself inside regular functions if the object precedes the invocation of the function.
Properties set as `this` do not refer to the object.
```js
var myObject = {
  property: this,
  regularFunction: function() {
    return this
  },
  arrowFunction: () => {
    return this
  },
  iife: (function() {
    return this
  })()
}
myObject.regularFunction() // myObject
myObject["regularFunction"]() // my Object
myObject.property // NOT myObject; lexical `this`
myObject.arrowFunction() // NOT myObject; lexical `this`
myObject.iife // NOT myObject; lexical `this`
const regularFunction = myObject.regularFunction
regularFunction() // NOT myObject; lexical `this`
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Event listeners
`this` refers to the element listening to the event.
```js
document.body.addEventListener("click", function() {
  console.log(this) // document.body
})
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Constructors
`this` refers to the newly created object.
```js
class Example {
  constructor() {
    console.log(this) // myExample
  }
}
const myExample = new Example()
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Manual
With `call()` and `apply()`, `this` refers to the object passed as the first argument.
```js
var myFunction = function() {
  return this
}
myFunction.call({ customThis: true }) // { customThis: true }
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Unwanted `this`
Because `this` can change depending on the scope, it can have unexpected values when using regular functions.
```js
var obj = {
  arr: [1, 2, 3],
  doubleArr() {
    return this.arr.map(function(value) {
      // this is now this.arr
      return this.double(value)
    })
  },
  double() {
    return value * 2
  }
}
obj.doubleArr() // Uncaught TypeError: this.double is not a function
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   In non-strict mode, global `this` is the global object (`window` in browsers), while in strict mode global `this` is `undefined`.
-   `Function.prototype.call` and `Function.prototype.apply` set the `this` context of an executing function as the first argument, with `call` accepting a variadic number of arguments thereafter, and `apply` accepting an array as the second argument which are fed to the function in a variadic manner.
-   `Function.prototype.bind` returns a new function that enforces the `this` context as the first argument which cannot be changed by other functions.
-   If a function requires its `this` context to be changed based on how it is called, you must use the `function` keyword. Use arrow functions when you want `this` to be the surrounding (lexical) context.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Mention of newly added `Symbol` data type

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the purpose of JavaScript UI libraries/frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Hyperapp, etc?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The main purpose is to avoid manipulating the DOM directly and keep the state of an application in sync with the UI easily. Additionally, they provide the ability to create components that can be reused when they have similar functionality with minor differences, avoiding duplication which would require multiple changes whenever the structure of a component which is reused in multiple places needs to be updated.
When working with DOM manipulation libraries like jQuery, the data of an application is generally kept in the DOM itself, often as class names or `data` attributes. Manipulating the DOM to update the UI involves many extra steps and can introduce subtle bugs over time. Keeping the state separate and letting a framework handle the UI updates when the state changes reduces cognitive load. Saying you want the UI to look a certain way when the state is a certain value is the declarative way of creating an application, instead of the imperative way of manually updating the UI to reflect the new state.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   The virtual DOM is a representation of the real DOM tree in the form of plain objects, which allows a library to write code as if the entire document is thrown away and rebuilt on each change, while the real DOM only updates what needs to be changed. Comparing the new virtual DOM against the previous one leads to high efficiency as changing real DOM nodes is costly compared to recalculating the virtual DOM.
-   JSX is an extension to JavaScript that provides XML-like syntax to create virtual DOM objects which is transformed to function calls by a transpiler. It simplifies control flow (if statements/ternary expressions) compared to tagged template literals.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What does `'use strict'` do and what are some of the key benefits to using it? ###
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Including `'use strict'` at the beginning of your JavaScript source file enables strict mode, which enforces more strict parsing and error handling of JavaScript code. It is considered a good practice and offers a lot of benefits, such as:
-   Easier debugging due to eliminating silent errors.
-   Disallows variable redefinition.
-   Prevents accidental global variables.
-   Oftentimes provides increased performance over identical code that is not running in strict mode.
-   Simplifies `eval()` and `arguments`.
-   Helps make JavaScript more secure.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Eliminates `this` coercion, throwing an error when `this` references a value of `null` or `undefined`.
-   Throws an error on invalid usage of `delete`.
-   Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript
###   <span style="color:red;"> Additional links
-   [MDN docs for strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode)
###   <span style="color:red;"> What are the differences between `var`, `let`, `const` and no keyword statements?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
###   <span style="color:red;"> No keyword
When no keyword exists before a variable assignment, it is either assigning a global variable if one does not exist, or reassigns an already declared variable. In non-strict mode, if the variable has not yet been declared, it will assign the variable as a property of the global object (`window` in browsers). In strict mode, it will throw an error to prevent unwanted global variables from being created.
###   <span style="color:red;"> var
`var` was the default statement to declare a variable until ES2015. It creates a function-scoped variable that can be reassigned and redeclared. However, due to its lack of block scoping, it can cause issues if the variable is being reused in a loop that contains an asynchronous callback because the variable will continue to exist outside of the block scope.
Below, by the time the the `setTimeout` callback executes, the loop has already finished and the `i` variable is `10`, so all ten callbacks reference the same variable available in the function scope.
```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // logs `10` ten times
    console.log(i)
  })
}
/* Solutions with `var` */
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // Passed as an argument will use the value as-is in
  // that point in time
  setTimeout(console.log, 0, i)
}
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // Create a new function scope that will use the value
  // as-is in that point in time
  ;(i => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(i)
    })
  })(i)
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> let
`let` was introduced in ES2015 and is the new preferred way to declare variables that will be reassigned later. Trying to redeclare a variable again will throw an error. It is block-scoped so that using it in a loop will keep it scoped to the iteration.
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // logs 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
    console.log(i)
  })
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> const
`const` was introduced in ES2015 and is the new preferred default way to declare all variables if they won't be reassigned later, even for objects that will be mutated (as long as the reference to the object does not change). It is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned.
```js
const myObject = {}
myObject.prop = "hello!" // No error
myObject = "hello" // Error
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   All declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope.
-   However, with `let` and `const` there is a concept called the temporal dead zone (TDZ). While the declarations are still hoisted, there is a period between entering scope and being declared where they cannot be accessed.
-   Show a common issue with using `var` and how `let` can solve it, as well as a solution that keeps `var`.
-   `var` should be avoided whenever possible and prefer `const` as the default declaration statement for all variables unless they will be reassigned later, then use `let` if so.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a virtual DOM and why is it used in libraries/frameworks?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a representation of the real DOM in the form of plain JavaScript objects. These objects have properties to describe the real DOM nodes they represent: the node name, its attributes, and child nodes.
``` {.sourceCode .html}
<div class="counter">
  <h1>0</h1>
  <button>-</button>
  <button>+</button>
</div>
```
The above markup's virtual DOM representation might look like this:
```js
{
  nodeName: "div",
  attributes: { class: "counter" },
  children: [
    {
      nodeName: "h1",
      attributes: {},
      children: [0]
    },
    {
      nodeName: "button",
      attributes: {},
      children: ["-"]
    },
    {
      nodeName: "button",
      attributes: {},
      children: ["+"]
    }
  ]
}
```
The library/framework uses the virtual DOM as a means to improve performance. When the state of an application changes, the real DOM needs to be updated to reflect it. However, changing real DOM nodes is costly compared to recalculating the virtual DOM. The previous virtual DOM can be compared to the new virtual DOM very quickly in comparison.
Once the changes between the old VDOM and new VDOM have been calculated by the diffing engine of the framework, the real DOM can be patched efficiently in the least time possible to match the new state of the application.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is WCAG? What are the differences between A, AA, and AAA compliance?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
WCAG stands for "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines". It is a standard describing how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities They have 12-13 guidelines and for each one, there are testable success criteria, which are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA. The higher the level, the higher the impact on the design of the web content. The higher the level, the web content is essentially more accessible by more users. Depending on where you live/work, there may be regulations requiring websites to meet certain levels of compliance. For instance, in Ontario, Canada, beginning January 1, 2021 all public websites and web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet AA compliance.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   A guideline for making web content more accessible
-   3 different levels (A, AA, and AAA) of compliance for each guideline
-   Governments are starting to require web content to meet a certain level of compliance by law

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a cross-site scripting attack (XSS) and how do you prevent it?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
XSS refers to client-side code injection where the attacker injects malicious scripts into a legitimate website or web application. This is often achieved when the application does not validate user input and freely injects dynamic HTML content.
For example, a comment system will be at risk if it does not validate or escape user input. If the comment contains unescaped HTML, the comment can inject a `<script>` tag into the website that other users will execute against their knowledge.
-   The malicious script has access to cookies which are often used to store session tokens. If an attacker can obtain a user's session cookie, they can impersonate the user.
-   The script can arbitrarily manipulate the DOM of the page the script is executing in, allowing the attacker to insert pieces of content that appear to be a real part of the website.
-   The script can use AJAX to send HTTP requests with arbitrary content to arbitrary destinations.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   On the client, using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` prevents the browser from running the string through the HTML parser which would execute scripts in it.
-   On the server, escaping HTML tags will prevent the browser from parsing the user input as actual HTML and therefore won't execute the script.

## Tools
> Awesome tools that will make your life easier.

### IDEs

| ☆ | Name | Platform | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ★★★ | [Vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php) | CLI / Cross-Platform | Vim is one of the most popular text editors among advanced programmers. It allows text-editing to be done very efficiently with solely keystrokes. Vim is also highly configurable, extensible and integrates with shells (command lines) really well. The only setback about Vim is that it has a high learning curve for beginners. |
| ★★★ | [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html) | CLI / Cross-Platform | Emacs is another popular text editor (or development environment to be more precise). The debate on "Vim vs. Emacs" is constantly brought up due to their popularity. Basically Emacs is more than just a text editor. It has plugins like file managers, web browsers, mail clients and news clients that allows users to performs these tasks directly inside Emacs. Emacs is "heavier" because of this, but it arguably has a relatively easier learning curve for beginners. |
| ★★★ | [Far Manager](https://www.farmanager.com/download.php?l=en) | Hybrid / Windows | Far Manager is the most widely-used editor in the RU/CIS competitive programming community. It's actually a file manager in its bare bones, but you can install [FarColorer](http://colorer.sourceforge.net/farplugin.html) - a syntax highlighter plugin to program on it. Properly configured, Far Manager allows you to navigate between files very efficiently while writing your codes. |
| ★★★ | [Code::Blocks](http://codeblocks.org/downloads) | GUI / Cross-Platform | Code::Blocks is the go-to IDE for C/C++. It's a full-fledged, versatile IDE with numerous great features. Code::Blocks is usually provided along with Vim in programming contests. |

Packed with powerful and innovative features like Multiple Carets, Minimaps and Command Palletes, it attracts a strong and engaging community. Sublime Text is highly extensible, so be sure to have [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) installed and explore perhaps one of the largest catalogue of plugins! |
| ★★☆ | [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) | GUI / Cross-Platform | Eclipse is another good IDE for Java. It's an okay alternative to Intellij IDEA (A tad inferior to IDEA by today's standards). Sometimes contests only provide Eclipse for some reason, so this might be a good incentive to try and use Eclipse. |
| ★★☆ | [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/) | GUI / Cross-Platform | CLion, produced by JetBrains - the same company who made Intellij IDEA, is a powerful IDE for C++. Free educational licenses are available OR you can try out their [EAP (Early Access Program)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/CLION/Early+Access+Program) which is still free as of Apr, 2018. You may want to turn off its code inspection feature as it will cause quite a bit of lag. |
| ★☆☆ | Other IDEs | Mixed | [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is the IDE to use in case you want to code in C#. ... Both [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are built with Electron (written in JavaScript) and therefore somewhat resource-hogging. ... [CodeLite](https://codelite.org/) is a newly rising IDE. Beware that the load-up and project-creation times can be extraordinary. |

# Hiring Without Whiteboards

A list of companies (or teams) that don't do "whiteboard" interviews. "Whiteboards" is used as a metaphor, and is a _symbol_ for the kinds of CS trivia questions that are associated with bad interview practices. Whiteboards are not bad – CS trivia questions are. Using sites like HackerRank/LeetCode _probably_ fall into a similar category.

The companies and teams listed here use interview techniques and questions that resemble day-to-day work. For example, pairing on a real world problem or a paid/unpaid take home exercise. Read (and contribute to) [our recommendations](RECOMMENDATIONS.md) for ways to conduct better interviews.

### tl;dr
- Discussing a real world problem (with or without whiteboard) is 👍
- Solving CS trivia, technical puzzles, riddles, brainteasers (with or without whiteboard) is 👎

Please open a [PR](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/pull/new/master) to be added.

### Duds

If you've been through an interview with one of these companies recently, and your experience suggests otherwise from their description, please open a [PR](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/pull/new/master) to remove them from this list.

### [Practice/ES6/Destructuring_Geneal.md](Practice/ES6/Destructuring_Geneal.md)
### General Object Destructuring Example

```js
let myObj = {
    name: "Luke",
    age: 25,
    hobbies: "music"
};

let { name, age, hobbies } = myObj;

console.log(name, age, hobbies);    // => Luke 25 music
```

Now the variables listed in between the curly braces are assigned the value of their respective properties in myObj.

### The order in which the variables are listed in the curly braces doesn't matter. Additionally, we don't have to list all the properties of an object if we only need one or two.

```js
console.log(age, name, hobbies);    // => 25 'Luke' 'music'

console.log(hobbies, name, age);    // => music Luke 25

console.log(hobbies, name);    // => music Luke

```

### General Array Destructuring Example

```js
let arr = ['Jim', 'Bob', 'Sarah', 'Cassie'];

let [ jim, bob, sarah, cassie ] = arr;

console.log(jim, bob, sarah, cassie); //outputs: Jim Bob Sarah Cassie
```

## Unlike objects, the name we give the variables doesn't matter. Let's change the above example:  So, each of the variable names will ONLY count for the index-positions I fetch.

```js
let arr = ['Jim', 'Bob', 'Sarah', 'Cassie'];

let [ var1, var2, var3, var4] = arr;

console.log(var1, var2, var3, var4); //outputs: Jim Bob Sarah Cassie
```

### If I include less variables then there are indexes in the arrays, then just like in Object-destructuring, only that many array element will be included in the returned array, starting from zero-index position and AGAIN without giving any meaning to the the name I give to the variables. So, each of the variable names will ONLY count for the index-positions I fetch.

let arr = ['Jim', 'Bob', 'Sarah', 'Cassie'];

let [ jim, bob, cassie ] = arr;

console.log(jim, bob, cassie); //outputs: Jim Bob Sarah

## Using Spread operator -  It is often used for splitting out a part of an object, but keeping the remaining properties in another object.

```js
let myObj = {

    name: "Luke",
    age: 25,
    hobbies: "music"

};

let { hobbies, ...rest } = myObj;  // => Luke 25 music

console.log(hobbies, rest)  // => music { name: 'Luke', age: 25 }

console.log(hobbies, rest.age)  // => music 25

```

# How .then() actually makes few asynchronous calls happen in particular order one after another

A> https://spring.io/understanding/javascript-promises

A function passed to then can also return another promise. This allows asynchronous operations to be chained together, so that they are guaranteed to happen in the correct order.

B> https://medium.com/codebuddies/getting-to-know-asynchronous-javascript-callbacks-promises-and-async-await-17e0673281ee

The true power of promises is shown when you have several asynchronous operations that depend on each other. So let's take the case where we have to make a request that depends on the result of another request.

## Callback Hell Example
Callbacks are a good way to declare what will happen once an I/O operation has a result, but what if you want to use that data in order to make another request? You can only handle the result of the request (if we use the example above) within the callback function provided.

```js
let request = require('request');

let result;

request('http://www.google.com', (error, response, body) => {
    if (error) {
        // Handle error
    } else {
        result = body;
        console.log("Request successful")
    }
})

console.log(result);

/* OUTPUT

undefined
Request successful
*/
```
In this example above, the variable “result" will not have a value when printed to the console at the last line. And will output “undefined" to the console because at the time that line is being executed, the callback has not been called. Even if the request were somehow to complete before the result variable is printed to the console (which is almost impossible as though, as inside the callback I am making a network request to google.com server), this code will still run to completion before the callback is executed anyway because that is the nature of the non-blocking I/O model in JavaScript.

## Because, by the non-blocking architecture, of JS / Node, while the callback is being executed ( making a request to google.com in this case) - the rest of the code after the callback function's block will continue to get executed.

``( See my explanation in - Asynchronous-Non-blocking-Mechanism-in-Node.md)``

So if we want to do a second request based on the result of a first one we have to do it inside the callback function of the first request because that is where the result will be available:
```js
let request = require('request');

let result;

request('http://www.google.com', function (firstError, firstResponse, firstBody) {
    if(firstError){
        // Handle error.
    }
    else {
        request(`https://www.facebook.com`, function (secondError, secondResponse, secondBody) {
            if(secondError){
                // Handle error.
            }
            else {
                result = secondBody;
                console.log('successfully hit facebook server')
            }
        });
    }
});

console.log(result);

/* OUTPUT

undefined
successfully hit facebook server
*/

```
One thing to note here is the first argument in every callback function will contain an error if something went wrong, or will be empty if all went well. This pattern is called “error first callbacks" and is very common. It is the standard pattern for callback-based APIs in NodeJs. This means that for every callback declared we need to check if there is an error and that just adds to the mess when dealing with nested callbacks.

This is the anti-pattern that has been named “callback hell".


### A promise is an object that wraps an asynchronous operation and notifies when it's done. This sounds exactly like callbacks, but the important differences are in the usage of Promises. Instead of providing a callback, a promise has its own methods (.then) which you call to tell the promise what will happen when it is successful or when it fails. The methods a promise provides are “then(…)" for when a successful result is available and “catch(…)" for when something went wrong.

Below is general syntax

```js
someAsyncOperation(someParams)
.then(function(result){
    // Do something with the result
})
.catch(function(error){
    // Handle error
});

```

So, handle the above case with Promise I am using “axios" that is similar to “request" package but it uses promises instead of callbacks.

```js
const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('http://www.somepage.com')
.then(function (response) {
    // response being the result of the first request
    // Returns another promise to the next .then(..) in the chain
    return axios.get(`http://www.somepage.com/${response.someValue}`);
})
.then(function response {
    // response being the result of the second request
    // Handle response
})
.catch(function (error) {
    // Handle error.
});

```

Instead of nesting callbacks inside callbacks inside callbacks, you chain .then() calls together making it more readable and easier to follow. Every .then() should either return a new Promise or just a value or object which will be passed to the next .then() in the chain. Another important thing to notice is that even though we are doing two different asynchronous requests we only have one .catch() where we handle our errors. That's because any error that occurs in the Promise chain will stop further execution and an error will end up in the next .catch() in the chain.

A friendly reminder: just like with callback based APIs, this is still asynchronous operations. The code that is executed when the request has finished — that is, the subsequent .then() calls — is put on the event loop just like a callback function would be. This means you cannot access any variables passed to or declared in the Promise chain outside the Promise. The same goes for errors thrown in the Promise chain.


### As a side note, remember the general syntax of chaining together axios calls

```JS
axios.get('http://google.com')
    .then((response) => {
        // do something with Google res
        return axios.get('http://apple.com')
        // response being the result of the first request
        // do something with Apple res
    })
    .catch((err) => {
        // handle err
    })

### [Resume-CV-Portfolio/general/2021-portfolio/bgoonz.github.io-master/bgoonz.github.io-master/feedbackform/live-form/node_modules/jquery/README.md](Resume-CV-Portfolio/general/2021-portfolio/bgoonz.github.io-master/bgoonz.github.io-master/feedbackform/live-form/node_modules/jquery/README.md)
# jQuery

> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.

For information on how to get started and how to use jQuery, please see [jQuery's documentation](https://api.jquery.com/).
For source files and issues, please visit the [jQuery repo](https://github.com/jquery/jquery).

If upgrading, please see the [blog post for 3.5.1](https://blog.jquery.com/2020/05/04/jquery-3-5-1-released-fixing-a-regression/). This includes notable differences from the previous version and a more readable changelog.

## Including jQuery

Below are some of the most common ways to include jQuery.

### Browser

#### Script tag

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
```

#### Babel

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is a next generation JavaScript compiler. One of the features is the ability to use ES6/ES2015 modules now, even though browsers do not yet support this feature natively.

```js
import $ from "jquery";
```

#### Browserify/Webpack

There are several ways to use [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). For more information on using these tools, please refer to the corresponding project's documentation. In the script, including jQuery will usually look like this...

```js
var $ = require( "jquery" );
```

#### AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition)

AMD is a module format built for the browser. For more information, we recommend [require.js' documentation](https://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html).

```js
define( [ "jquery" ], function( $ ) {

} );
```

### Node

To include jQuery in [Node](https://nodejs.org/), first install with npm.

```sh
npm install jquery
```

For jQuery to work in Node, a window with a document is required. Since no such window exists natively in Node, one can be mocked by tools such as [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom). This can be useful for testing purposes.

```js
const { JSDOM } = require( "jsdom" );
const { window } = new JSDOM( "" );
const $ = require( "jquery" )( window );
```

# Your Resume

Your resume is your personal summary sheet.  Your resume is the thing that gets your foot in the door.  So, there's a few things you should do (and not do) to make it as awesome as you are.

### Make your name **BIG.**

Your name has to stand out from everything else, because you want it to be remembered.  Making it the biggest thing on the page is the easiest thing you can do to make that possible.  I've seen soooo many resumes where the name is at the top, but it's just bolded and centered and they expect that to be enough.  It's not.  

### Remove the objective.

Nobody looks at the objective.  Nobody.  I personally spoke to a bunch of recruiters from various companies and they all said that they never look at them.  Use that space to talk about projects you've done, activities you've done, etc.

### Keep it to a single page.

Recruiters are looking for a short summary of you.  They're reading several resumes a day, and if they see something longer than they typically read, they could pass over yours for something more concise!  If you'd like to say more, put a link to a personal website or portfolio for someone to find it.  A resume is a summary, not a tome.

### Remove irrelevant information.

I know that lifeguarding in high school was a good gig that helped you gain people skills and attention to detail.  But you're in tech.  That doesn't matter as much to tech companies.  Sorry, buddy.  I still think you're great with people.
When you're a first semester freshman, it's okay to have old high school stuff on there, just because it's less likely that you have other things to put on your resume.  But as soon as you have a college GPA to work with, a club or two, and some volunteer experiences to replace that, do it.

### Don't make it a scavenger hunt.

When an application reviewer (engineer, recruiter, or otherwise) is looking over your resume, don't make it difficult for them to understand who you are and what you know. 

For example, if you have online profiles like GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, or even your own personal website, put it on your resume.  Don't make them have to search long and hard for you online if they want to know more!

If you decide to put relevant coursework on your resume, **please**, don't just put course numbers.  Nobody knows what that means.  And nobody is going to go to your university's website to find out exactly what CS229 is.  Put down the course titles instead!

And finally, put down your graduation date.  So many students I've seen don't put it on there because they are hiding the fact that they're a freshman, or they're "technically a junior if you count the credits."  That doesn't matter.  Trust me.  Just put down your graduation date so that the company knows how much experience you have, and how soon they can potentially pull you in for full-time.

### Include only certain personal information.

Companies aren't allowed to ask about your religion, marital status, or race/ethnicity, so you shouldn't include that.  

In terms of contact information: you don't need your mailing address.  That is a thing of the past.  Just like my youth.  Tech companies email, and **maybe** call.  That's all you need!
Some great things that you might also want to put on there are your personal website (if you have one, which you should), your GitHub profile (if you have one, which you should), and your LinkedIn (if you have one, which you should).

Though there's some who might disagree, you should **include your GPA.**  If your major GPA is significantly higher than your overall GPA, you might want to consider having both.  When you have graduated and have a full-time job, you won't need it as much.  But at this point in your beautiful life, keep it in there.  Some companies care about GPA more than others, so you might as well play it safe and have it there.

# CV Sample

Your cover letter is your written sales pitch.  You've got a resume that summarizes everything.  Now you have to write out a more complete, professional description of you and what you can offer a given company.  Here's a sample cover letter to get you started:

> Dear _________, 
>
> I hope your day is going well! My name is _________, and I'm a _________ at _________. I am very interested in working for _________ next _________. Your commitment to _________ and _________ that I saw on the website inspired me! The products you build and the values you stand for make _________ seem like an ideal workplace for me.

A little about me, I [insert relevant work experience, extracurriculars, and projects here]. I think these experiences would make me a great candidate for you.

>
> Please let me know if there's anything else you need from me. I look forward to hearing from you! I can be reached at _________ and _________.
>
> Best regards, 
> _________

Now, remember, this is just a sample.  You can write a cover letter in any format you'd like.  But, you should be sure to include the following:

* **Who** - Who you are.  Easy enough.
* **Where** - Where you're coming from.
* **Why** - Why you're interested in this company, and show that you researched them.
* **What** - What you can bring to the table.
* **When** - When you're available to start, and when they can contact you.
* **How** - How they can reach you.

# Your Attitude

When you're internship/job hunting, it's very easy to feel down if you don't hear back from companies, an interview goes poorly, or you start comparing yourself to people.  It's a tough field we're going into.

So.  I won't spend much time on this.  But I want to emphasize something: **You're brilliant.**  You're in this field for a reason.  When your grades aren't awesome or someone gets something that you wanted, don't feel down on yourself.  So many opportunities will come your way if you just keep working hard and refining your skills.

Mark Twain once said, "Comparison is the death of joy."  When you start to compare your skills to others, it's hard to not feel as good about your own, or to get a little too competitive about your work.  Work hard and don't let others get you down.  It's remarkable how significantly that can improve both your work and your interviewing experience!

When you're talking to companies and recruiters at career fairs and hackathons and over the phone, be confident, not arrogant.  Be grateful for the opportunity they're giving you, and smile!  A great attitude will take you VERY far.

# Your Skills

Obviously, your skills are what a company is buying from you when they hire you.  So, honing in those skills and presenting them in an effective way is *probably* the most important thing in getting a gig.

## Building Them

Chances are, if you've had a data structures and/or algorithms class, you're already going to do pretty well in the technical interviews.  That is, if you can recall the information you learned.

Here's a checklist of things that you should probably be prepared to know in a technical interview:

* Data types
* Basic Bitwise Operations
* String Operations
* Arrays
* Linked Lists
  + Singly Linked
  + Doubly Linked
  + Circular Linked
* Queues
* Stacks
* Heaps
* Trees
  + Binary Trees
  + Binary Search Trees
  + Tries
  + Self Balancing Trees
* Traversing Trees
  + Breadth First Search - BFS
  + Depth First Search - DFS
  + Preorder, Inorder, Postorder
* Graphs
  + Dijkstra's Algorithm / A* Search
* Hash Maps
  + Handling Collisions
* Sorting algorithms
  + Insertion
  + Selection
  + Merge
  + Quick
* Time Complexities

This guide isn't for teaching you these skills.  But there are several guides, problem sets, and practice systems out there that can help.

Typically, for an internship or your first job, questions won't get much more specific unless you're applying for a specific role.  For example, if I wanted to be a mobile intern, I might be asked iOS/Android/Windows Phone specific questions, or if I wanted to be a web intern, I might be asked HTML/CSS/JavaScript questions, or if I wanted to be a backend intern, I might be asked about Django or Node or Ruby on Rails.  That definitely depends on the company, and what you're both looking for.

Make sure you're able to implement and use the above data structures without the assistance of an IDE. Typically, onsite technical interviews involve coding on paper or a whiteboard, and phone/video interviews usually involve some kind of collaborative text editor. Yes, that means you won't have access to auto-complete, auto-compiling, or the internet to check for errors. So be ready for that!

## Selling Them

When you're actively emailing and speaking with recruiters, they're going to ask you a lot of questions that are just checkboxes for what they're looking for in terms of skills.

If you've written anything in a language before, **put it on your resume**.  A lot of companies have parsers that look for specific things that, again, will put a tick on those checkboxes before putting you through to the next round of review.  Now, if you've only ever done "Hello, world!" in Python, don't say that you're a Python ninja or whatever.  You don't want to be thrown into an interview that will only hurt your self-confidence.  Speaking from experience.  Trust me.

When a recruiter or engineer is asking you about a certain project you've done, or how you've used a particular language, be as specific as possible.  Tell them **exactly** what you did on that particular project (or internship or what have you).  Tell them how much you contributed, what languages you used, how long was the duration of development for that project, what was the outcome of the project, etc. etc.

For example, don't say, "I'm the webmaster for a club website. Next question."  Okay, Dwight Schrute.  Go back to your beet farm.  Instead, say something more like this: "I developed and currently maintain the website for my university's computer science club. I built it from the ground up with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery on the front-end.  It's a static site, so a backend wasn't needed.  The website's main function is to promote the club and give members crucial updates about meetings and events, and I update it regularly via a Python script I wrote."  Oh my, you enchanting software engineer, you.  Let me hire you.

When you're talking to companies about specific things you've done, make sure they know:

* **What?** - What? - What did you make? What does it do? What impact has it made? What was the hardest part? What could you have done better?
* **Why?** - Why did you make it?  Was it for a hackathon, a school project, an open source contribution, or something else?
* **How?** - With which technologies did you make this?  Did you use a specific API?  What parts of it did you work on?
* **When?** - Did you do this recently or are you still living off of when you peaked in 10th grade?
* **Who?** - Did you work on this with anyone?  Who did what?  Who is this for?

Your skills are something that you have, and the reason why you have them is because you've used them in some way.  All you have to do to prove yourself is to explain yourself!  No need to gGetting a Gig: A Guide

Your skills are something that you have, and the reason why you have them is because you've used them in some way.  All you have to do to prove yourself is to explain yourself!  No need to go overboard and brag.  Just be honest, and confident.

# Your Search

You have a resume and cover letter in hand, and you have the skills to make anyone want you.  Now, you just have to find the right gig for you.

## Events

When you're on the hunt for a great internship or first job, the events you go to can really set you apart, and will help you meet people that could potentially help you in the long run.

The biggies that you will definitely run into are:

* Hackathons
* Meetups
* Conferences
* Career Fairs

So, how do you find these events?  They're happening all the time, you just need to know where to look.  Firstly, ask people in the field.  Talk to a mentor, a fellow student, a professor, a colleague... anyone could come through for you!  I remember my first tech event I went to in college was because I ran into a guy that I met orientation day.  And now he and I are coworkers.  Fancy that.  Anyway, people can get you very far.

Otherwise, when people don't work, we always have the glorious internet leading the way.  There's so many resources out there I definitely can't list them all.  So I'll list just a few.

* Your School - Yeah, this is kind of an easy shot, but not a lot of people consider their schools as an event generator, when they should.  Go on to your university's website and find the career fair, find a seminar, find a company presentation, find something that will help you learn and meet people.  You'll probably find a lot of options!
* [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com) - Meetup is a great place to find groups of people who are interested in the same things you are, who meet regularly.  Look for engineering meetups that are hosted **at** companies.  You'll get to see an office, and meet people who actually work there (in addition to those who might work at other organizations).
* [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) - Eventbrite is best for finding events that aren't recurring.  You can often find workshops, networking events, parties, and classes there.  I tend to just search for the term, "tech" or "computer" and the results simply flow.  Like a babbling brook.  Or something.
* [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/) - MLH provides a fairly thorough schedule of university hackathons every semester.  Most of the events on their schedule provide travel reimbursement, but there's so many that you'll likely find one near you!
* [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/) - Lanyrd is a "social conference directory" that is full of conferences based on almost any topic.  Follow your favorite speakers or search for a particular language or technology, and you'll be set.

Like I mentioned before, there's a lot of resources out there for finding events.  Now that you have places to go to, what do you do there?
WHAT A CLEVER SEGUE.

## Networking

The whole point of going to events (besides learning something, of course) is to network.  Meeting and maintaining relationships with people in this industry is essential.

So, how **do** you just network with people?  How do you make it as natural as eating pie on Pi Day?  I'll show you, Bert.

First of all, don't think of it as networking.  You don't want to get the heebie-jeebies.  Think of it as meeting people who like what you like.  When you're at these events, you'll occasionally see groups of people staying in their own groups, not often reaching out to others.  You're not going to do that.  You're going to be a professional, social butterfly.

Follow generally these steps (as casually or formally as the event calls for) when networking:

1. Introduce yourself.  This seems obvious, but you'd be surprised how often people just sort of slide into a conversation without ever actually providing anyone with their name or title.  Go up to people and tell them who you are.

2. Make small talk about tech.  Again, an obvious tip, but important.  You want to know what this person's skills are, and you want them to know yours.  Someday, they might be looking for someone to help them on a project in a language that you know, or vice-versa.  Get the important details out in the open about each other so that not only you can remember each other, but you can help each other out in the future.  And don't forget to have fun with it!

3. Exchange contact information.  If you have no way of finding the person you're talking to again, and they don't have a way of finding you, then you're just wasting a potentially valuable connection.  Whether you give them a business card or an email address, or even a Twitter handle, keep that information!

4. Follow-up.  This is probably **the most important thing I will tell you in this whole guide.**  Hence the bold letters.  So pretty.  Anyway.  Following up is the guaranteed way of leaving an impression with someone.  Whether you email or tweet or InMail or Facebook message or pigeon mail, just sending a simple, "it was nice to meet you!" message is absolutely **vital** when it comes to networking.  I've actually heard stories of people changing their mind about hiring someone based on a follow-up message.  And following up doesn't stop at the "nice to meet you" message.  At some point down the line, it's great practice to send a "how are you doing?" message to someone you're interested in maintaining a relationship with.  For all three of my mentors that I had in college (and to this day), the way we built our relationship was through these sorts of follow-up messages.  **Do them.**

Networking is about building relationships, and what you can do with those relationships is up to you.  But we're talking about getting a job.  So let's move on to one of the best ways of getting one, with these relationships.

## Referrals

Referrals are your in.  If you can get a referral from an employee of the company you're applying for, that's money.  It pushes you towards the top of the pile of resumes that they're getting every single day.  Using the relationships you've built from networking, all it takes is a simple ask!  You can get a referral from current employees, former ones, interns, former interns, friends of engineers, acquaintances of recruiters... really, anyone who is connected with the company.  If they have a job posting up for a given position, they are looking around for engineers just as much as you're looking around for a great gig!  The company knows that they're going to be speaking with someone potentially really good (because they were recommended by someone trusted), and you get to speak to a company for whom you want to work.  Having a referral is a win for both parties.  

Asking for a referral really depends on your relationship with the referrer.  If you know them in a strictly business setting, you might want to send them a more professional request.  But if you know the referrer pretty well, chances are you know how to ask for a favor.  One thing that you must remember though is to, again, **follow up**!  If you haven't heard back from your referrer, reach out and check on your status.  If they let you know that you're in the system, be gracious and take them for coffee or something.  Common courtesy.  You've got this.

## Cold Calling

A lot of people are fans of cold calling, which is making unsolicited contact with a person at a company and hoping for something good to come of it.  I admit, I'm not one of those people.  Seems spammy.  But, I'll tell you about some ways to do that anyway, to make your cold calls as potentially successful as possible.

First of all, you should have an email for someone at the company you're looking at.  You could ask around your network for contact information for a given person, or you could just go out on a limb and [test some emails to see if they're valid](http://mailtester.com/).  A lot of companies have fairly standard email address templates (firstname.lastname@company.com, for example), so you can just keep sending a few until you find a legitimate one.  If you need names to test out, you can scour LinkedIn or the company's website to try and find something that works.

Once you have a legitimate email on your hands, get to work on making a personalized message to them.  Emphasis on the personal.  When you're cold calling, you can't have just any standard email template where you stick in the company's name where it fits.  You have to clearly let the person know why you're writing, from where you got their information (if it's not just a random guess, of course), why you would be a good fit for the company (where you will **sell** those awesome skills of yours), and why you think the company is great.  Essentially, you're writing a glorified cover letter.

When the email has been sent, you're done.  If you haven't heard back in a week or two, send a follow-up, but if they still haven't replied after that, chances are they won't reply at all.  And that's okay.  It happens.  That's the territory when it comes to cold calling.

## Fellowships

Fellowships are a great way to network with a community and get valuable mentorship that will most certainly help you in the long run.  They vary depending on the program, but typically you'll get assigned a mentor or two, go to several events to network with professionals, and intern for a company that has partnered with the specific fellowship program.

Here's a list of some example fellowship programs.  This is by no means a complete list (feel free to send a pull request or file an issue if there's another you'd like to be added), but it should get you started!

* [Cansbridge Fellowship](http://www.cansbridgefellowship.com/)
* [CODE2040](http://code2040.org/)
* [FirstMark Elite](http://firstmarkelite.com/)
* [First Round Capital](http://www.university.firstround.com/)
* [Ford-Mozilla Fellows](https://advocacy.mozilla.org/open-web-fellows/)
* [hackNY Fellows](http://apply.hackny.org/)
* [Knight-Mozilla Fellows](http://opennews.org/fellowships/)
* [KPCB Fellows](http://kpcbfellows.com/)
* [Mayfield Fellows Program](http://stvp.stanford.edu/mayfield-fellows-program/)
* [NYC Turing Fellows](http://nycturingfellows.org/)
* [PennApps Fellows](http://www.pennappsfellows.com/)
* [True Entrepreneur Corps](http://www.trueventures.com/tec/)

In addition to these fellowships, several companies offer special programs for younger students that are similarly geared towards learning and mentorship.  Here's another list that is not complete, but will get you started:

* [Microsoft Explore](http://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/us/university-programs.aspx) (I'm biased because I did this one, but this program is AWESOME)
* [Google Engineering Practicum](https://www.google.com/jobs/students/engpracticum)
* [Facebook University of Engineering](https://www.facebook.com/careers/university/fbueng)
* [Intel IRISE](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/jobs/locations/united-states/students/internships/intel-early-internship-software-engineering.html)
* [Qualcomm EIP (Early Identification Program)](https://www.qualcomm.com/company/careers/interns)
* [Pinterest Engage Software Engineer Intern] (https://careers.pinterest.com/careers/details/pinterest-engage-software-engineer-intern_san-francisco_143952)

o overboard and brag.  Just be honest, and confident.

#### Snippet of the Day:


---
### Fibonacci in Python:

```py
def fib_iter(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    p0 = 0
    p1 = 1
    for i in range(n-1):
        next_val = p0 + p1
        p0 = p1
        p1 = next_val
    return next_val
for i in range(10):
    print(f'{i}: {fib_iter(i)}')
```




 ---
 
 #### Yesterday's Snippet of the day:

---

```py
def quicksort(l):
    # One of our base cases is an empty list or list with one element
    if len(l) == 0 or len(l) == 1:
        return l
    # If we have a left list, a pivot point and a right list...
    # assigns the return values of the partition() function
    left, pivot, right = partition(l) 
    # Our sorted list looks like left + pivot + right, but sorted.
    # Pivot has to be in brackets to be a list, so python can concatenate all the elements to a single list
    return quicksort(left) + [pivot] + quicksort(right)
# print(quicksort([]))
# print(quicksort([1]))
# print(quicksort([1,2]))
# print(quicksort([2,1]))
# print(quicksort([2,2]))
# print(quicksort([5,3,9,4,8,1,7]))
# print(quicksort([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]))
# print(quicksort([9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]))

###  Node Cheat Sheet

```js
/*************************
 * //NODE-JS-CHEAT-SHEET *
 *************************/
var http = require('http');
// An example of a web server written with Node which responds with 'Hello World'.
// To run the server, put the code into a file called example.js and execute it with the node program.
http.createServer(function (request, response) {
response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
response.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(8124);
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8124/');
/* *******************************************************************************************
* GLOBAL OBJECTS
* http://nodejs.org/api/globals.html
* ******************************************************************************************* */
// In browsers, the top-level scope is the global scope.
// That means that in browsers if you're in the global scope var something will define a global variable.
// In Node this is different. The top-level scope is not the global scope; var something inside a Node module will be local to that module.
__filename;  // The filename of the code being executed. (absolute path)
__dirname;   // The name of the directory that the currently executing script resides in. (absolute path)
module;      // A reference to the current module. In particular module.exports is used for defining what a module exports and makes available through require().
exports;     // A reference to the module.exports that is shorter to type.
process;     // The process object is a global object and can be accessed from anywhere. It is an instance of EventEmitter.
Buffer;      // The Buffer class is a global type for dealing with binary data directly.
* CONSOLE
* http://nodejs.org/api/console.html
console.log([data], [...]);             // Prints to stdout with newline.
console.info([data], [...]);            // Same as console.log.

console.dir(obj);                       // Uses util.inspect on obj and prints resulting string to stdout.
console.time(label);                    // Mark a time.
console.timeEnd(label);                 // Finish timer, record output.
console.trace(label);                   // Print a stack trace to stderr of the current position.
console.assert(expression, [message]);  // Same as assert.ok() where if the expression evaluates as false throw an AssertionError with message.
* TIMERS
* http://nodejs.org/api/timers.html
setTimeout(callback, delay, [arg], [...]);   // To schedule execution of a one-time callback after delay milliseconds. Optionally you can also pass arguments to the callback.
clearTimeout(t);                             // Stop a timer that was previously created with setTimeout().
setInterval(callback, delay, [arg], [...]);  // To schedule the repeated execution of callback every delay milliseconds. Optionally you can also pass arguments to the callback.
clearInterval(t);                            // Stop a timer that was previously created with setInterval().
setImmediate(callback, [arg], [...]);        // To schedule the "immediate" execution of callback after I/O events callbacks and before setTimeout and setInterval.
clearImmediate(immediateObject);             // Stop a timer that was previously created with setImmediate().
unref();  // Allow you to create a timer that is active but if it is the only item left in the event loop, node won't keep the program running.
ref();    // If you had previously unref()d a timer you can call ref() to explicitly request the timer hold the program open.
* MODULES
* http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html
var module = require('./module.js');    // Loads the module module.js in the same directory.
module.require('./another_module.js');  // load another_module as if require() was called from the module itself.
module.id;        // The identifier for the module. Typically this is the fully resolved filename.
module.filename;  // The fully resolved filename to the module.
module.loaded;    // Whether or not the module is done loading, or is in the process of loading.
module.parent;    // The module that required this one.

// If you want the root of your module's export to be a function (such as a constructor)
// or if you want to export a complete object in one assignment instead of building it one property at a time,
// assign it to module.exports instead of exports.

return {
area: function() {
return width * width;
}
* PROCESS
* http://nodejs.org/api/process.html
process.on('exit', function(code) {});              // Emitted when the process is about to exit
process.on('uncaughtException', function(err) {});  // Emitted when an exception bubbles all the way back to the event loop. (should not be used)
process.stdout;           // A writable stream to stdout.
process.stderr;           // A writable stream to stderr.
process.stdin;            // A readable stream for stdin.
process.argv;             // An array containing the command line arguments.

process.execArgv;         // This is the set of node-specific command line options from the executable that started the process.
process.arch;             // What processor architecture you're running on: 'arm', 'ia32', or 'x64'.
process.config;           // An Object containing the JavaScript representation of the configure options that were used to compile the current node executable.
process.pid;              // The PID of the process.
process.platform;         // What platform you're running on: 'darwin', 'freebsd', 'linux', 'sunos' or 'win32'.
process.title;            // Getter/setter to set what is displayed in 'ps'.
process.version;          // A compiled-in property that exposes NODE_VERSION.
process.versions;         // A property exposing version strings of node and its dependencies.
process.abort();          // This causes node to emit an abort. This will cause node to exit and generate a core file.
process.chdir(dir);       // Changes the current working directory of the process or throws an exception if that fails.
process.cwd();            // Returns the current working directory of the process.

process.initgroups(user, extra_grp);  // Reads /etc/group and initializes the group access list, using all groups of which the user is a member.
process.kill(pid, [signal]);          // Send a signal to a process. pid is the process id and signal is the string describing the signal to send.
process.memoryUsage();                // Returns an object describing the memory usage of the Node process measured in bytes.
process.nextTick(callback);           // On the next loop around the event loop call this callback.
process.maxTickDepth;                 // Callbacks passed to process.nextTick will usually be called at the end of the current flow of execution, and are thus approximately as fast as calling a function synchronously.
process.umask([mask]);                // Sets or reads the process's file mode creation mask.
process.uptime();                     // Number of seconds Node has been running.
process.hrtime();                     // Returns the current high-resolution real time in a [seconds, nanoseconds] tuple Array.
* CHILD PROCESS
* http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html
// Node provides a tri-directional popen facility through the child_process module.
// It is possible to stream data through a child's stdin, stdout, and stderr in a fully non-blocking way.

* EVENTS
* http://nodejs.org/api/events.html
// All objects which emit events are instances of events.EventEmitter. You can access this module by doing: require("events");
// To access the EventEmitter class, require('events').EventEmitter.
// All EventEmitters emit the event 'newListener' when new listeners are added and 'removeListener' when a listener is removed.
emitter.addListener(event, listener);        // Adds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event.
emitter.on(event, listener);                 // Same as emitter.addListener().
emitter.once(event, listener);               // Adds a one time listener for the event. This listener is invoked only the next time the event is fired, after which it is removed.
emitter.removeListener(event, listener);     // Remove a listener from the listener array for the specified event.
emitter.removeAllListeners([event]);         // Removes all listeners, or those of the specified event.
emitter.setMaxListeners(n);                  // By default EventEmitters will print a warning if more than 10 listeners are added for a particular event.
emitter.listeners(event);                    // Returns an array of listeners for the specified event.
emitter.emit(event, [arg1], [arg2], [...]);  // Execute each of the listeners in order with the supplied arguments. Returns true if event had listeners, false otherwise.
EventEmitter.listenerCount(emitter, event);  // Return the number of listeners for a given event.
* STREAM
* http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html
// A stream is an abstract interface implemented by various objects in Node. For example a request to an HTTP server is a stream, as is stdout.
// Streams are readable, writable, or both. All streams are instances of EventEmitter.
// The Readable stream interface is the abstraction for a source of data that you are reading from.
// In other words, data comes out of a Readable stream.
// A Readable stream will not start emitting data until you indicate that you are ready to receive it.
// Examples of readable streams include: http responses on the client, http requests on the server, fs read streams
// zlib streams, crypto streams, tcp sockets, child process stdout and stderr, process.stdin.
var readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
readable.on('readable', function() {});   // When a chunk of data can be read from the stream, it will emit a 'readable' event.
readable.on('data', function(chunk) {});  // If you attach a data event listener, then it will switch the stream into flowing mode, and data will be passed to your handler as soon as it is available.
readable.on('end', function() {});        // This event fires when there will be no more data to read.
readable.on('close', function() {});      // Emitted when the underlying resource (for example, the backing file descriptor) has been closed. Not all streams will emit this.
readable.on('error', function() {});      // Emitted if there was an error receiving data.
// The read() method pulls some data out of the internal buffer and returns it. If there is no data available, then it will return null.
// This method should only be called in non-flowing mode. In flowing-mode, this method is called automatically until the internal buffer is drained.
readable.read([size]);
readable.setEncoding(encoding);           // Call this function to cause the stream to return strings of the specified encoding instead of Buffer objects.
readable.resume();                        // This method will cause the readable stream to resume emitting data events.
readable.pause();                         // This method will cause a stream in flowing-mode to stop emitting data events.
readable.pipe(destination, [options]);    // This method pulls all the data out of a readable stream, and writes it to the supplied destination, automatically managing the flow so that the destination is not overwhelmed by a fast readable stream.
readable.unpipe([destination]);           // This method will remove the hooks set up for a previous pipe() call. If the destination is not specified, then all pipes are removed.
readable.unshift(chunk);                  // This is useful in certain cases where a stream is being consumed by a parser, which needs to "un-consume" some data that it has optimistically pulled out of the source, so that the stream can be passed on to some other party.
// The Writable stream interface is an abstraction for a destination that you are writing data to.
// Examples of writable streams include: http requests on the client, http responses on the server, fs write streams,
// zlib streams, crypto streams, tcp sockets, child process stdin, process.stdout, process.stderr.
var writer = getWritableStreamSomehow();
writable.write(chunk, [encoding], [callback]);  // This method writes some data to the underlying system, and calls the supplied callback once the data has been fully handled.
writer.once('drain', write);                    // If a writable.write(chunk) call returns false, then the drain event will indicate when it is appropriate to begin writing more data to the stream.
writable.end([chunk], [encoding], [callback]);  // Call this method when no more data will be written to the stream.
writer.on('finish', function() {});             // When the end() method has been called, and all data has been flushed to the underlying system, this event is emitted.
writer.on('pipe', function(src) {});            // This is emitted whenever the pipe() method is called on a readable stream, adding this writable to its set of destinations.
writer.on('unpipe', function(src) {});          // This is emitted whenever the unpipe() method is called on a readable stream, removing this writable from its set of destinations.
writer.on('error', function(src) {});           // Emitted if there was an error when writing or piping data.
// Duplex streams are streams that implement both the Readable and Writable interfaces. See above for usage.
// Examples of Duplex streams include: tcp sockets, zlib streams, crypto streams.
// Transform streams are Duplex streams where the output is in some way computed from the input. They implement both the Readable and Writable interfaces. See above for usage.
// Examples of Transform streams include: zlib streams, crypto streams.

* http://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html
// This module provides utilities for dealing with query strings. Call require('querystring') to use it.

querystring.parse(str, [sep], [eq], [options]);  // Deserialize a query string to an object. Optionally override the default separator ('&') and assignment ('=') characters.
* ASSERT
* http://nodejs.org/api/assert.html
// This module is used for writing unit tests for your applications, you can access it with require('assert').
assert.fail(actual, expected, message, operator);     // Throws an exception that displays the values for actual and expected separated by the provided operator.
assert(value, message); assert.ok(value, [message]);  // Tests if value is truthy, it is equivalent to assert.equal(true, !!value, message);
assert.equal(actual, expected, [message]);            // Tests shallow, coercive equality with the equal comparison operator ( == ).
assert.notEqual(actual, expected, [message]);         // Tests shallow, coercive non-equality with the not equal comparison operator ( != ).
assert.deepEqual(actual, expected, [message]);        // Tests for deep equality.
assert.notDeepEqual(actual, expected, [message]);     // Tests for any deep inequality.
assert.strictEqual(actual, expected, [message]);      // Tests strict equality, as determined by the strict equality operator ( === )
assert.notStrictEqual(actual, expected, [message]);   // Tests strict non-equality, as determined by the strict not equal operator ( !== )
assert.throws(block, [error], [message]);             // Expects block to throw an error. error can be constructor, RegExp or validation function.
assert.doesNotThrow(block, [message]);                // Expects block not to throw an error, see assert.throws for details.
assert.ifError(value);                                // Tests if value is not a false value, throws if it is a true value. Useful when testing the first argument, error in callbacks.
* OS
* http://nodejs.org/api/os.html
// Provides a few basic operating-system related utility functions.
// Use require('os') to access this module.
os.tmpdir();             // Returns the operating system's default directory for temp files.
os.endianness();         // Returns the endianness of the CPU. Possible values are "BE" or "LE".
os.hostname();           // Returns the hostname of the operating system.
os.type();               // Returns the operating system name.
os.platform();           // Returns the operating system platform.
os.arch();               // Returns the operating system CPU architecture.

os.networkInterfaces();  // Get a list of network interfaces.
os.EOL;                  // A constant defining the appropriate End-of-line marker for the operating system.
* BUFFER
* http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html
// Buffer is used to dealing with binary data
// Buffer is similar to an array of integers but corresponds to a raw memory allocation outside the V8 heap
Buffer.from(size);                                                  // Allocates a new buffer of size octets.
Buffer.from(array);                                                 // Allocates a new buffer using an array of octets.
Buffer.from(str, [encoding]);                                       // Allocates a new buffer containing the given str. encoding defaults to 'utf8'.
Buffer.isEncoding(encoding);                                        // Returns true if the encoding is a valid encoding argument, or false otherwise.
Buffer.isBuffer(obj);                                               // Tests if obj is a Buffer
Buffer.concat(list, [totalLength]);                                 // Returns a buffer which is the result of concatenating all the buffers in the list together.
Buffer.byteLength(string, [encoding]);                              // Gives the actual byte length of a string.
buf.write(string, [offset], [length], [encoding]);                  // Writes string to the buffer at offset using the given encoding
buf.toString([encoding], [start], [end]);                           // Decodes and returns a string from buffer data encoded with encoding (defaults to 'utf8') beginning at start (defaults to 0) and ending at end (defaults to buffer.length).
buf.toJSON();                                                       // Returns a JSON-representation of the Buffer instance, which is identical to the output for JSON Arrays
buf.copy(targetBuffer, [targetStart], [sourceStart], [sourceEnd]);  // Does copy between buffers. The source and target regions can be overlapped
buf.slice([start], [end]);                                          // Returns a new buffer which references the same memory as the old, but offset and cropped by the start (defaults to 0) and end (defaults to buffer.length) indexes. Negative indexes start from the end of the buffer.   
buf.fill(value, [offset], [end]);                                   // Fills the buffer with the specified value
buf[index];                                                         // Get and set the octet at index
buf.length;                                                         // The size of the buffer in bytes, Note that this is not necessarily the size of the contents
buffer.INSPECT_MAX_BYTES;                                           // How many bytes will be returned when buffer.inspect() is called. This can be overridden by user modules.

[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#installation)

## ➤ Installation

```javascript
npm install @appnest/readme -D
```

If you don't want to install anything you can use the `npx @appnest/readme generate` command instead.

[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#getting-started-quick)

## ➤ Getting Started (quick)

This getting started guide is super quick! Follow these two steps and you will have turned your boring readme into a pretty one.

1. Rename your current `README.md` file to `blueprint.md`.
2. Run `npx @appnest/readme generate`

That's it! Check out your freshly generated `README.md` file and enjoy the fruits of what you just did.


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#getting-started-slower)

## ➤ Getting Started (slower)

This getting started guide is a little bit longer, but will give you some superpowers. Spend a minute reading this getting started guide and you'll have the best README file in your town very soon.

### Blueprint

First you need to create a `blueprint.md` file. This blueprint is going to be the blueprint for the `README.md` file we will generate later.

Let's start simple. In order to get values from your `package.json` file injected into the README file we use the mustache syntax (`{{ .. }}`). Let's say your `package.json` file looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "@appnest/readme",
  "version": "1.2.5"
}
```

To get the `name` and `version` into your README file you will need to write `{{ pkg.name }}` and `{{ pkg.version }}` in your `blueprint.md` file like this:

```markdown
Welcome to {{ pkg.name }}. This is version {{ pkg.version }}!
```

When running `node_modules/.bin/readme generate` the file `README.md` will be generated with the following contents:

```markdown
Welcome to @appnest/readme. This is version 1.2.5.
```

### Usage

Run the `node_modules/.bin/readme generate` command and a README file will be generated for you. If you want to go into depth with the readme command, check out the following options or write `node_modules/.bin/readme generate -h` in your terminal if that's your cup of tea.

### Configuration

To configure this library you'll need to create a `blueprint.json` file. This file is the configuration for the templates we are going to take a look at in the next section. If you want to interpolate values from the configuration file into your README file you can simply reference them without a scope. Eg. if you have the field "link" in your `blueprint.json` you can write `{{ link }}` to reference it.

Great. Now that we have the basics covered, let's continue and see how you can use templates!

[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#templates)

## ➤ Templates

If you have come this far you are probably interested to figure out how to use README templates. This library comes with a set of pre-defined templates to make your readme awesome, but you can of course create your own. More about that later, let's not get ahead of our self just yet.

### Title

Let's start with the title template. To generate the title you write `{{ template:title }}` in your blueprint. When you run the `readme` command the template will generate the following:

<h1 align="center">@appnest/readme</h1>

The important thing to note here is that the template automatically reads your `package.json` file and inserts the `name` from the package.

```json
{
  "name": "@appnest/readme"
}
```

That's cool. Let's go through some of the other built-in templates you might want to add.

### Logo

The logo template adds a logo to your readme and looks like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/logo-shadow.png" alt="Logo" width="150" height="150" />
</p>

Use the placeholder `{{ template:logo }}` to stamp it. You will need to add the `logo` field to your `blueprint.json`. The logo field requires an `src` field. Optionally you can provide values for `width`, `height` and `alt`. Below is an example on how to add the data for the logo template.

```json
{
  "logo": {
    "src": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/logo-shadow.png",
    "width": "150"
  }
}
```

### Badges

The badges template adds badges to your readme and looks like this:

<p align="center">
		<a href="https://npmcharts.com/compare/@appnest/readme?minimal=true"><img alt="Downloads per month" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@appnest/readme.svg" height="20"/></a>
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@appnest/readme"><img alt="NPM Version" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@appnest/readme.svg" height="20"/></a>
<a href="https://david-dm.org/andreasbm/readme"><img alt="Dependencies" src="https://img.shields.io/david/andreasbm/readme.svg" height="20"/></a>
<a href="https://github.com/andreasbm/readme/graphs/contributors"><img alt="Contributors" src="https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/andreasbm/readme.svg" height="20"/></a>
<a href="https://github.com/badges/shields"><img alt="Custom badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/custom-badge-f39f37.svg" height="20"/></a>
<a href="https://github.com/andreasbm/readme/graphs/commit-activity"><img alt="Maintained" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintained%3F-yes-green.svg" height="20"/></a>
	</p>


Use the `{{ template:badges }}` placeholder to stamp it. You will need to add the data about how the badges should be generated. For that you can extend the `ids` property in your `blueprint.json` and add the `npm` and `github` ids (both are optional). If you want to add your own badges you can use the `badges` field.

```json
{
  "ids": {
    "github": "andreasbm/readme",
    "npm": "@appnest/readme"
  },
  "badges": [
    {
      "alt": "Custom badge",
      "url": "https://github.com/badges/shields",
      "img": "https://img.shields.io/badge/custom-badge-f39f37.svg"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Description

The description template adds a description to your readme and looks like this:

<p align="center">
  <b>Automatically generate a beautiful best-practice README file based on the contents of your repository</b></br>
  <sub>Use this readme generator to easily generate beautiful readme's like this one! Simply extend your <code>package.json</code> and create a readme blueprint. On Github, the README file is like the landing page of your website because it is the first thing visitors see. You want to make a good first impression.<sub>
</p>

<br />


Use the `{{ template:description }}` placeholder to stamp it. To use this template you are required to add the field `description` to your `package.json` file. Optionally you can also add the fields `text` and `demo` in your `blueprint.json` file which will be presented below the description.

// package.json

```json
{
  "description": "Automatically generate a beautiful best-practice README file based on the contents of your repository"
}
```

// blueprint.json

```json
{
  "text": "Use this readme generator to easily generate beautiful readme's like this one! Simply extend your <code>package.json</code> and create a readme blueprint. On Github, the README file is like the landing page of your website because it is the first thing visitors see. You want to make a good first impression."
}
```

### Table of Contents

The table of contents template adds a table of contents and looks like this:


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#table-of-contents)

* [➤ License](#-license-1)

Use the `{{ template:toc }}` placeholder to stamp it. It has been scientifically proven that this template will save you approximately 392.3 hours during your life-time. Seriously.

### Contributors

The contributors template adds the list of contributors and looks like this:


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#contributors)

## ➤ Contributors
	

| [<img alt="Andreas Mehlsen" src="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6267397?s=460&v=4" width="100">](https://twitter.com/andreasmehlsen) | [<img alt="You?" src="https://joeschmoe.io/api/v1/random" width="100">](https://github.com/andreasbm/readme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) |
|:--------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------:|
| [Andreas Mehlsen](https://twitter.com/andreasmehlsen) | [You?](https://github.com/andreasbm/readme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) |
| 🔥                                               |                                                  |


Use the `{{ template:contributors }}` placeholder to stamp it. Let's sa To use this template your are required to add the `contributors` array to your `package.json` file like this. Only the `name` field is required.

```json
{
  "contributors": [
    {
      "name": "Andreas Mehlsen",
      "email": "hello@example.com",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/andreasmehlsen",
      "img": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6267397?s=460&v=4",
      "info": [
        "🔥"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "You?",
      "img": "https://joeschmoe.io/api/v1/random",
      "url": "https://github.com/andreasbm/readme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

Take note of the `info` array. That one is really exciting! Here you can add lines describing the contributors - for example the role of accomplishments. Take a look [here](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for more inspiration of what you could put into the info array.

### License

The license template adds a license section and looks like this:


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#license)

## ➤ License
	
Licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Use the `{{ template:license }}` placeholder to stamp it. To use this template you are required to add the `license` field to your `package.json` file like this.

```json
{
  "license": "license"
}
```



[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#load-markdown-files)

## ➤ Load markdown files

What? You heard right. You can split the contents of your readme into multiple different files to make your life easier. Let's say you have a file called `my-section.md`. To stamp it you'll need to add `{{ load:my-section.md }}`.

[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#automatic-documentation)

## ➤ Automatic documentation

Welcome to the future. Here we have **automatic documentation of web components!**. Let's say you have the following web component inside a file called `my-button.js`.

```javascript
/**
 * Button used for clicking!
 * @slot - Default content
 */
export class MyButton extends HTMLElement {

  /**
   * Attributes being observed.
   * @returns {string[]}
   */
  static get observedAttributes() {
    return ["disabled", "role"];
  }
  
  /**
   * Disables the element.
   * @attr
   * @type {boolean}
   */
  disabled = false;

  /**
   * Role of the element.
   * @attr
   * @type {string}
   */
  role = "button";
}

customElements.define("my-button", MyButton);
```

Then you can get automatic documentation for the web component by simply writing `{{ doc:my-button.js }}` which will result in the following content.


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#my-button)

## ➤ my-button

Button used for clicking!

### Properties

| Property   | Attribute  | Type      | Default  | Description           |
|------------|------------|-----------|----------|-----------------------|
| `disabled` | `disabled` | `boolean` | false    | Disables the element. |
| `role`     | `role`     | `string`  | "button" | Role of the element.  |

### Slots

| Name | Description     |
|------|-----------------|
|      | Default content |

[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#a-bit-about-this-readme)

## ➤ A bit about this readme

By now you are probably curious to know how this README file was generated? It was created from the following `blueprint.md` file.

```markdown
{{ template:logo }}
{{ template:title }}
{{ template:badges }}
{{ template:description }}
{{ bullets }}
{{ template:toc }}
{{ load:readme/1-installation.md }}
{{ load:readme/2-getting-started.md }}
{{ load:readme/3-templates.md }}
{{ load:readme/4-load-markdown.md }}
{{ load:readme/5-automatic-documentation.md }}
{{ load:readme/6-this-readme.md }}
{{ load:readme/7-custom-templates.md }}
{{ load:readme/8-advanced.md }}
{{ load:readme/9-featured-readmes.md }}
{{ load:readme/10-future-work.md }}
{{ load:readme/11-faq.md }}
{{ template:contributors }}
{{ template:license }}
```

It really couldn't be more simple that this.

[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#custom-templates)

## ➤ Custom templates

You are able to create your own templates to keep things as DRY as a hot summer day. To create your own templates you'll first need to add the `templates` array to your `blueprint.json` file like this.

```json
{
  "templates": [
    {
      "name": "install",
      "template": "Run `npm install {{ ids.npm }} to install this library!"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then you can stamp your custom template using the `{{ template:install }}` syntax ("install" here referencing the name of the custom template). The below is an example of what is stamped to the README file using the above template.

Run `npm install @appnest/readme' to install this library!

Be creative! You can for example add a template for code-snippets or [words you keep spelling wrong](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/spelling/common-misspellings).

## ➤ Advanced!

Oh! So are you ready to open Pandora's box? Let's do it.

### Check broken links

Add the `checkLinks` field to your `blueprint.json` and you'll be notified about all broken links in your README file. This check use [check-links](https://www.npmjs.com/package/check-links) to check links for aliveness.

```json
{
  "checkLinks": true
}
```

### New template syntax

If you are in the mood you can change the syntax used for matching with the templates. Let's say you want your placeholders to look like this instead `{[ template:title }]`. Then you'll need to add the `placeholder` array to your `blueprint.json` file with the new syntax being `["{[", "}]"]` like this.


```json
{
  "placeholder": ["{[", "}]"]
}
```

### Variables

If you have a variable from your `blueprint.json` file you want to stamp to your README file just use the `{{ ... }}` syntax as usual without any scopes.

#### Objects

Objects are formatted as a list with the keys being bold. If you for example want to stamp the `dependencies` field from your `package.json` file you write `{{ pkg.dependencies }}` and the dependencies will be stamped in a nice formatted way like this.

* **@types/glob**: ^7.1.1
* **check-links**: ^1.1.8
* **colors**: ^1.4.0
* **commander**: ^5.0.0
* **fs-extra**: ^9.0.0
* **glob**: ^7.1.6
* **path**: ^0.12.7
* **web-component-analyzer**: 1.0.3

#### 1D Arrays

If you have a 1D array it will be formatted as a list. If you for example want to stamp the the `keywords` field from your `package.json` file you write `{{ pkg.keywords }}` and the keywords will be stamped in a nice formatted way like this:

* opensource
* project
* readme
* template
* boilerplate
* nodejs
* maintaining
* generator

#### 2D Arrays

If you have a 2D array it will be formatted as a table. This is very convenient for things like documentation of API's. Let's say you have the following in your `blueprint.json`.

```json
{
  "properties": [
    ["Attribute", "Type", "Description"],
    ["**size**", "'medium', 'large'", "Determines the size" ],
    ["**active**", "boolean", "Whether the element is active or not" ]
  ]
}
```

Then you can stamp it to your readme by writing `{{ properties }}` and it will be formatted as a table.


| Attribute  | Type              | Description                          |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **size**   | 'medium', 'large' | Determines the size                  |
| **active** | boolean           | Whether the element is active or not |


You are welcome!

### Different colored lines

If you want to change the color of the lines above headers you can change the `line` field in the `blueprint.json`. Here's an example if you want a dark line instead of the colored one.

```json
{
  "line": "dark"
}
```

The following is the dark variant of the line.

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/dark.png)

Yeah! Dark mode on your `README.md` is awesome indeed. You have other options besides dark mode. Here's all the line styles you can choose from.

* "aqua" ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/aqua.png)
* "cloudy" ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/cloudy.png)
* "colored" ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)
* "cut" ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/cut.png)
* "dark" ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/dark.png)
* "fire" ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/fire.png)
* "grass" ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/grass.png)
* "rainbow" ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)
* "solar" ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/solar.png)
* "vintage" ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/vintage.png)
* "water" ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/water.png)

If you want your own line design you can give the `line` field an url to an image instead. It is recommended that this image is 900px in width. If you prefer no line at all you can give the `line` field the string "none".

### Different formatted headings

If you want to change the prefix in front of the heading you can change the `headingPrefix` in the `blueprint.json` file. Just map the heading level to the desired prefix as shown below.

```json
{
  "headingPrefix": {
    "1": "➜ ",
    "2": "⭑ "
  }
}
```

If you want some inspiration for symbols you can put infront of the headings you can check out [this](https://unicodes.smpc.io/) website.

## ➤ Featured README's

If you use this generator for one of your projects I would love to hear about it so I can feature it. Here's a list of some repositories using this generator for their README file.

* [lit-translate](https://github.com/andreasbm/lit-translate)
* [masonry-layout](https://github.com/andreasbm/masonry-layout)
* [focus-trap](https://github.com/andreasbm/focus-trap)
* [web-router](https://github.com/andreasbm/web-router)
* [web-config](https://github.com/andreasbm/web-config)
* [ts-lit-plugin](https://github.com/runem/ts-lit-plugin)
* [blob](https://github.com/andreasbm/blob)

As inspiration for the layout of the generated README files I initially found inspiration from [terkelg's brilliant repository called prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts) - a prime example on how every README file should look! I therefore wanted to mention him here even though he doesn't use this README generator. If you want to see an example of a brilliant README file you should definitely check his repository out.


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#future-work)

## ➤ Future work

That's it for now! Lot's of exiting features a going to be added in the future. If you stumble upon an issue or have a feature request you are very welcome to open a Github issue or pull request. Have a great day!


[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/colored.png)](#faq)

## ➤ FAQ

### Can I see how my README file is going to look before I commit it?

Yes you definitely can! There are lots of tools out there for editing/previewing Github flavored markdown. I recommend using [https://stackedit.io/app](https://stackedit.io/app) to preview the final result since it is super lightweight and does it job well.

### How can I get involved?

Create an issue or pull-request. You are also very welcome to throw me a message at [@AndreasMehlsen](https://twitter.com/andreasmehlsen).

### I already have a large README file - I don't have time to rewrite everything!

No problem at all! Your first step can be to rename your `README.md` to `blueprint.md` and run `node_modules/.bin/readme generate`. Already then your README should now be well-formatted. Then you can slowly replace the contents when you have time. The low-hanging fruit would be to add the table of contents and license using respectively the `{{ template:toc }}` and `{{ template:license }}` templates.

### How can I support you?

There are lot's of ways to support me! I would be so happy if you gave this repository a star, tweeted about it or told your friends about this little corner of the Internet ❤️

# @nodelib/fs.scandir

> List files and directories inside the specified directory.

## :bulb: Highlights

The package is aimed at obtaining information about entries in the directory.

* :moneybag: Returns useful information: `name`, `path`, `dirent` and `stats` (optional).
* :gear: On Node.js 10.10+ uses the mechanism without additional calls to determine the entry type. See [`old` and `modern` mode](#old-and-modern-mode).
* :link: Can safely work with broken symbolic links.

## Install

```console
npm install @nodelib/fs.scandir
```

## Usage

```ts
import * as fsScandir from '@nodelib/fs.scandir';

fsScandir.scandir('path', (error, stats) => { /* … */ });
```

## API

### .scandir(path, [optionsOrSettings], callback)

Returns an array of plain objects ([`Entry`](#entry)) with information about entry for provided path with standard callback-style.

```ts
fsScandir.scandir('path', (error, entries) => { /* … */ });
fsScandir.scandir('path', {}, (error, entries) => { /* … */ });
fsScandir.scandir('path', new fsScandir.Settings(), (error, entries) => { /* … */ });
```

### .scandirSync(path, [optionsOrSettings])

Returns an array of plain objects ([`Entry`](#entry)) with information about entry for provided path.

```ts
const entries = fsScandir.scandirSync('path');
const entries = fsScandir.scandirSync('path', {});
const entries = fsScandir.scandirSync(('path', new fsScandir.Settings());
```

#### path

* Required: `true`
* Type: `string | Buffer | URL`

A path to a file. If a URL is provided, it must use the `file:` protocol.

#### optionsOrSettings

* Required: `false`
* Type: `Options | Settings`
* Default: An instance of `Settings` class

An [`Options`](#options) object or an instance of [`Settings`](#settingsoptions) class.

> :book: When you pass a plain object, an instance of the `Settings` class will be created automatically. If you plan to call the method frequently, use a pre-created instance of the `Settings` class.

### Settings([options])

A class of full settings of the package.

```ts
const settings = new fsScandir.Settings({ followSymbolicLinks: false });

const entries = fsScandir.scandirSync('path', settings);
```

## Entry

* `name` — The name of the entry (`unknown.txt`).
* `path` — The path of the entry relative to call directory (`root/unknown.txt`).
* `dirent` — An instance of [`fs.Dirent`](./src/types/index.ts) class. On Node.js below 10.10 will be emulated by [`DirentFromStats`](./src/utils/fs.ts) class.
* `stats` (optional) — An instance of `fs.Stats` class.

For example, the `scandir` call for `tools` directory with one directory inside:

```ts
{
	dirent: Dirent { name: 'typedoc', /* … */ },
	name: 'typedoc',
	path: 'tools/typedoc'
}
```

## Options

### stats

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Adds an instance of `fs.Stats` class to the [`Entry`](#entry).

> :book: Always use `fs.readdir` without the `withFileTypes` option. ??TODO??

### followSymbolicLinks

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Follow symbolic links or not. Call `fs.stat` on symbolic link if `true`.

### `throwErrorOnBrokenSymbolicLink`

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Throw an error when symbolic link is broken if `true` or safely use `lstat` call if `false`.

### `pathSegmentSeparator`

* Type: `string`
* Default: `path.sep`

By default, this package uses the correct path separator for your OS (`\` on Windows, `/` on Unix-like systems). But you can set this option to any separator character(s) that you want to use instead.

### `fs`

* Type: [`FileSystemAdapter`](./src/adapters/fs.ts)
* Default: A default FS methods

By default, the built-in Node.js module (`fs`) is used to work with the file system. You can replace any method with your own.

```ts
interface FileSystemAdapter {
	lstat?: typeof fs.lstat;
	stat?: typeof fs.stat;
	lstatSync?: typeof fs.lstatSync;
	statSync?: typeof fs.statSync;
	readdir?: typeof fs.readdir;
	readdirSync?: typeof fs.readdirSync;
}

const settings = new fsScandir.Settings({
	fs: { lstat: fakeLstat }
});
```

## `old` and `modern` mode

This package has two modes that are used depending on the environment and parameters of use.

### old

* Node.js below `10.10` or when the `stats` option is enabled

When working in the old mode, the directory is read first (`fs.readdir`), then the type of entries is determined (`fs.lstat` and/or `fs.stat` for symbolic links).

### modern

* Node.js 10.10+ and the `stats` option is disabled

In the modern mode, reading the directory (`fs.readdir` with the `withFileTypes` option) is combined with obtaining information about its entries. An additional call for symbolic links (`fs.stat`) is still present.

This mode makes fewer calls to the file system. It's faster.

# @nodelib/fs.walk

> A library for efficiently walking a directory recursively.

## :bulb: Highlights

* :moneybag: Returns useful information: `name`, `path`, `dirent` and `stats` (optional).
* :rocket: On Node.js 10.10+ uses the mechanism without additional calls to determine the entry type for performance reasons. See [`old` and `modern` mode](https://github.com/nodelib/nodelib/blob/master/packages/fs/fs.scandir/README.md#old-and-modern-mode).
* :gear: Built-in directories/files and error filtering system.
* :link: Can safely work with broken symbolic links.

## Install

```console
npm install @nodelib/fs.walk
```

## Usage

```ts
import * as fsWalk from '@nodelib/fs.walk';

fsWalk.walk('path', (error, entries) => { /* … */ });
```

## API

### .walk(path, [optionsOrSettings], callback)

Reads the directory recursively and asynchronously. Requires a callback function.

> :book: If you want to use the Promise API, use `util.promisify`.

```ts
fsWalk.walk('path', (error, entries) => { /* … */ });
fsWalk.walk('path', {}, (error, entries) => { /* … */ });
fsWalk.walk('path', new fsWalk.Settings(), (error, entries) => { /* … */ });
```

### .walkStream(path, [optionsOrSettings])

Reads the directory recursively and asynchronously. [Readable Stream](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams) is used as a provider.

```ts
const stream = fsWalk.walkStream('path');
const stream = fsWalk.walkStream('path', {});
const stream = fsWalk.walkStream('path', new fsWalk.Settings());
```

### .walkSync(path, [optionsOrSettings])

Reads the directory recursively and synchronously. Returns an array of entries.

```ts
const entries = fsWalk.walkSync('path');
const entries = fsWalk.walkSync('path', {});
const entries = fsWalk.walkSync('path', new fsWalk.Settings());
```

#### path

* Required: `true`
* Type: `string | Buffer | URL`

A path to a file. If a URL is provided, it must use the `file:` protocol.

#### optionsOrSettings

* Required: `false`
* Type: `Options | Settings`
* Default: An instance of `Settings` class

An [`Options`](#options) object or an instance of [`Settings`](#settings) class.

> :book: When you pass a plain object, an instance of the `Settings` class will be created automatically. If you plan to call the method frequently, use a pre-created instance of the `Settings` class.

### Settings([options])

A class of full settings of the package.

```ts
const settings = new fsWalk.Settings({ followSymbolicLinks: true });

const entries = fsWalk.walkSync('path', settings);
```

## Entry

* `name` — The name of the entry (`unknown.txt`).
* `path` — The path of the entry relative to call directory (`root/unknown.txt`).
* `dirent` — An instance of [`fs.Dirent`](./src/types/index.ts) class.
* [`stats`] — An instance of `fs.Stats` class.

## Options

### basePath

* Type: `string`
* Default: `undefined`

By default, all paths are built relative to the root path. You can use this option to set custom root path.

In the example below we read the files from the `root` directory, but in the results the root path will be `custom`.

```ts
fsWalk.walkSync('root'); // → ['root/file.txt']
fsWalk.walkSync('root', { basePath: 'custom' }); // → ['custom/file.txt']
```

### concurrency

* Type: `number`
* Default: `Infinity`

The maximum number of concurrent calls to `fs.readdir`.

> :book: The higher the number, the higher performance and the load on the File System. If you want to read in quiet mode, set the value to `4 * os.cpus().length` (4 is default size of [thread pool work scheduling](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/threadpool.html#thread-pool-work-scheduling)).

### deepFilter

* Type: [`DeepFilterFunction`](./src/settings.ts)
* Default: `undefined`

A function that indicates whether the directory will be read deep or not.

```ts
// Skip all directories that starts with `node_modules`
const filter: DeepFilterFunction = (entry) => !entry.path.startsWith('node_modules');
```

### entryFilter

* Type: [`EntryFilterFunction`](./src/settings.ts)
* Default: `undefined`

A function that indicates whether the entry will be included to results or not.

```ts
// Exclude all `.js` files from results
const filter: EntryFilterFunction = (entry) => !entry.name.endsWith('.js');
```

### errorFilter

* Type: [`ErrorFilterFunction`](./src/settings.ts)
* Default: `undefined`

A function that allows you to skip errors that occur when reading directories.

For example, you can skip `ENOENT` errors if required:

```ts
// Skip all ENOENT errors
const filter: ErrorFilterFunction = (error) => error.code == 'ENOENT';
```

### stats

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Adds an instance of `fs.Stats` class to the [`Entry`](#entry).

> :book: Always use `fs.readdir` with additional `fs.lstat/fs.stat` calls to determine the entry type.

### followSymbolicLinks

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Follow symbolic links or not. Call `fs.stat` on symbolic link if `true`.

### `throwErrorOnBrokenSymbolicLink`

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Throw an error when symbolic link is broken if `true` or safely return `lstat` call if `false`.

### `pathSegmentSeparator`

* Type: `string`
* Default: `path.sep`

By default, this package uses the correct path separator for your OS (`\` on Windows, `/` on Unix-like systems). But you can set this option to any separator character(s) that you want to use instead.

### `fs`

	lstatSync: typeof fs.lstatSync;
	statSync: typeof fs.statSync;
	readdir: typeof fs.readdir;
	readdirSync: typeof fs.readdirSync;
}

const settings = new fsWalk.Settings({
	fs: { lstat: fakeLstat }
});

# is [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/is.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/is)

> Type check values: `is.string('🦄') //=> true`

<img src="header.gif" width="182" align="right">


## Install

```
$ npm install @sindresorhus/is
```


## Usage

```js
const is = require('@sindresorhus/is');

is('🦄');
//=> 'string'

is(new Map());
//=> 'Map'

is.number(6);
//=> true
```

When using `is` together with TypeScript, [type guards](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#type-guards-and-differentiating-types) are being used to infer the correct type inside if-else statements.

```ts
import is from '@sindresorhus/is';

const padLeft = (value: string, padding: string | number) => {
	if (is.number(padding)) {
		// `padding` is typed as `number`
		return Array(padding + 1).join(' ') + value;
	}

	if (is.string(padding)) {
		// `padding` is typed as `string`
		return padding + value;
	}

	throw new TypeError(`Expected 'padding' to be of type 'string' or 'number', got '${is(padding)}'.`);
}

padLeft('🦄', 3);
//=> '   🦄'

padLeft('🦄', '🌈');
//=> '🌈🦄'
```


## API

### is(value)

Returns the type of `value`.

Primitives are lowercase and object types are camelcase.

Example:

- `'undefined'`
- `'null'`
- `'string'`
- `'symbol'`
- `'Array'`
- `'Function'`
- `'Object'`

Note: It will throw an error if you try to feed it object-wrapped primitives, as that's a bad practice. For example `new String('foo')`.

### is.{method}

All the below methods accept a value and returns a boolean for whether the value is of the desired type.

#### Primitives

Returns `true` if the value is a `Map` and the `.size` is more than 0.

#### Miscellaneous

##### .directInstanceOf(value, class)

Returns `true` if `value` is a direct instance of `class`.

```js
const url = 'https://example.com';

is.url(url);
//=> true

is.url(new URL(url));

//=> true

function foo() {
	is.arrayLike(arguments);
	//=> true
}
foo();
```

##### .inRange(value, range)

Check if `value` (number) is in the given `range`. The range is an array of two values, lower bound and upper bound, in no specific order.

```js
is.inRange(3, [0, 5]);
is.inRange(3, [5, 0]);
is.inRange(0, [-2, 2]);
```

//=> true

is.any(is.boolean, 'unicorns', [], new Map());
//=> false
```

##### .all(predicate, ...values)

Returns `true` if **all** of the input `values` returns true in the `predicate`:

```js
is.all(is.object, {}, new Map(), new Set());
//=> true

is.all(is.string, '🦄', [], 'unicorns');
//=> false
```


## FAQ

### Why yet another type checking module?

There are hundreds of type checking modules on npm, unfortunately, I couldn't find any that fit my needs:

- Includes both type methods and ability to get the type
- Types of primitives returned as lowercase and object types as camelcase
- Covers all built-ins
- Unsurprising behavior
- Well-maintained
- Comprehensive test suite

For the ones I found, pick 3 of these.

The most common mistakes I noticed in these modules was using `instanceof` for type checking, forgetting that functions are objects, and omitting `symbol` as a primitive.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### onlyFirst

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false` *(Matches any ANSI escape codes in a string)*

Match only the first ANSI escape.


## FAQ

### Why do you test for codes not in the ECMA 48 standard?

Some of the codes we run as a test are codes that we acquired finding various lists of non-standard or manufacturer specific codes. We test for both standard and non-standard codes, as most of them follow the same or similar format and can be safely matched in strings without the risk of removing actual string content. There are a few non-standard control codes that do not follow the traditional format (i.e. they end in numbers) thus forcing us to exclude them from the test because we cannot reliably match them.

On the historical side, those ECMA standards were established in the early 90's whereas the VT100, for example, was designed in the mid/late 70's. At that point in time, control codes were still pretty ungoverned and engineers used them for a multitude of things, namely to activate hardware ports that may have been proprietary. Somewhere else you see a similar 'anarchy' of codes is in the x86 architecture for processors; there are a ton of "interrupts" that can mean different things on certain brands of processors, most of which have been phased out.

# ansi-styles [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chalk/ansi-styles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chalk/ansi-styles)

> [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors_and_Styles) for styling strings in the terminal

You probably want the higher-level [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) module for styling your strings.

<img src="screenshot.svg" width="900">

## Install

```
$ npm install ansi-styles
```

## Usage

```js
const style = require('ansi-styles');

console.log(`${style.green.open}Hello world!${style.green.close}`);


// Color conversion between 16/256/truecolor
// NOTE: If conversion goes to 16 colors or 256 colors, the original color
//       may be degraded to fit that color palette. This means terminals
//       that do not support 16 million colors will best-match the
//       original color.
console.log(style.bgColor.ansi.hsl(120, 80, 72) + 'Hello world!' + style.bgColor.close);
console.log(style.color.ansi256.rgb(199, 20, 250) + 'Hello world!' + style.color.close);
console.log(style.color.ansi16m.hex('#abcdef') + 'Hello world!' + style.color.close);
```

## API

Each style has an `open` and `close` property.

## Styles

### Modifiers

- `reset`
- `bold`
- `dim`
- `italic` *(Not widely supported)*
- `underline`
- `inverse`
- `hidden`
- `strikethrough` *(Not widely supported)*

### Colors

- `black`
- `red`
- `green`
- `yellow`
- `blue`
- `magenta`
- `cyan`
- `white`
- `blackBright` (alias: `gray`, `grey`)
- `redBright`
- `greenBright`
- `yellowBright`
- `blueBright`
- `magentaBright`
- `cyanBright`
- `whiteBright`

### Background colors

- `bgBlack`
- `bgRed`
- `bgGreen`
- `bgYellow`
- `bgBlue`
- `bgMagenta`
- `bgCyan`
- `bgWhite`
- `bgBlackBright` (alias: `bgGray`, `bgGrey`)
- `bgRedBright`
- `bgGreenBright`
- `bgYellowBright`
- `bgBlueBright`
- `bgMagentaBright`
- `bgCyanBright`
- `bgWhiteBright`

## Advanced usage

By default, you get a map of styles, but the styles are also available as groups. They are non-enumerable so they don't show up unless you access them explicitly. This makes it easier to expose only a subset in a higher-level module.

- `style.modifier`
- `style.color`
- `style.bgColor`

###### Example

```js
console.log(style.color.green.open);
```

Raw escape codes (i.e. without the CSI escape prefix `\u001B[` and render mode postfix `m`) are available under `style.codes`, which returns a `Map` with the open codes as keys and close codes as values.

###### Example

```js
console.log(style.codes.get(36));
//=> 39
```

## [256 / 16 million (TrueColor) support](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728)

`ansi-styles` uses the [`color-convert`](https://github.com/Qix-/color-convert) package to allow for converting between various colors and ANSI escapes, with support for 256 and 16 million colors.

The following color spaces from `color-convert` are supported:

- `rgb`
- `hex`
- `keyword`
- `hsl`
- `hsv`
- `hwb`
- `ansi`
- `ansi256`

To use these, call the associated conversion function with the intended output, for example:

```js
style.color.ansi.rgb(100, 200, 15); // RGB to 16 color ansi foreground code
style.bgColor.ansi.rgb(100, 200, 15); // RGB to 16 color ansi background code

style.color.ansi256.hsl(120, 100, 60); // HSL to 256 color ansi foreground code
style.bgColor.ansi256.hsl(120, 100, 60); // HSL to 256 color ansi foreground code

style.color.ansi16m.hex('#C0FFEE'); // Hex (RGB) to 16 million color foreground code
style.bgColor.ansi16m.hex('#C0FFEE'); // Hex (RGB) to 16 million color background code
```

Sometimes you need to check if you're on _at least_ a given Node.js version, but you don't want to pull in the whole [`semver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver) kitchen sink. That's what `at-least-node` is for.

| Package         | Size    |
| --------------- | ------- |
| `at-least-node` | 2.6 kB  |
| `semver`        | 75.5 kB |

```js
const atLeastNode = require('at-least-node')
atLeastNode('10.12.0')
// -> true on Node 10.12.0+, false on anything below that
```

When passing in a version string:

- You cannot include a leading `v` (i.e. `v10.12.0`)
- You cannot omit sections (i.e. `10.12`)
- You cannot use pre-releases (i.e. `1.0.0-beta`)
- There is no input validation, if you make a mistake, the resulting behavior is undefined

[![downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/balanced-match.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/balanced-match)

[![testling badge](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/balanced-match.png)](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/balanced-match)

## Example

Get the first matching pair of braces:

```js
var balanced = require('balanced-match');

console.log(balanced('{', '}', 'pre{in{nested}}post'));
console.log(balanced('{', '}', 'pre{first}between{second}post'));
console.log(balanced(/\s+\{\s+/, /\s+\}\s+/, 'pre  {   in{nest}   }  post'));
```

The matches are:

```bash
$ node example.js
{ start: 3, end: 14, pre: 'pre', body: 'in{nested}', post: 'post' }
{ start: 3,
  end: 9,
  pre: 'pre',
  body: 'first',
  post: 'between{second}post' }
{ start: 3, end: 17, pre: 'pre', body: 'in{nest}', post: 'post' }
```

## API

### var m = balanced(a, b, str)

For the first non-nested matching pair of `a` and `b` in `str`, return an
object with those keys:

* **start** the index of the first match of `a`
* **end** the index of the matching `b`
* **pre** the preamble, `a` and `b` not included
* **body** the match, `a` and `b` not included
* **post** the postscript, `a` and `b` not included

If there's no match, `undefined` will be returned.

If the `str` contains more `a` than `b` / there are unmatched pairs, the first match that was closed will be used. For example, `{{a}` will match `['{', 'a', '']` and `{a}}` will match `['', 'a', '}']`.

### var r = balanced.range(a, b, str)

For the first non-nested matching pair of `a` and `b` in `str`, return an
array with indexes: `[ <a index>, <b index> ]`.

If there's no match, `undefined` will be returned.

If the `str` contains more `a` than `b` / there are unmatched pairs, the first match that was closed will be used. For example, `{{a}` will match `[ 1, 3 ]` and `{a}}` will match `[0, 2]`.

## Installation

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```bash
npm install balanced-match
```

# brace-expansion

[Brace expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Brace-Expansion.html), 
as known from sh/bash, in JavaScript.

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/juliangruber/brace-expansion.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/juliangruber/brace-expansion)
[![downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/brace-expansion.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/brace-expansion)
[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/juliangruber/brace-expansion.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

[![testling badge](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion.png)](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion)

## Example

```js
var expand = require('brace-expansion');

expand('file-{a,b,c}.jpg')
// => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-b.jpg', 'file-c.jpg']

expand('-v{,,}')
// => ['-v', '-v', '-v']

expand('file{0..2}.jpg')
// => ['file0.jpg', 'file1.jpg', 'file2.jpg']

expand('file-{a..c}.jpg')
// => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-b.jpg', 'file-c.jpg']

expand('file{2..0}.jpg')
// => ['file2.jpg', 'file1.jpg', 'file0.jpg']

expand('file{0..4..2}.jpg')
// => ['file0.jpg', 'file2.jpg', 'file4.jpg']

expand('file-{a..e..2}.jpg')
// => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-c.jpg', 'file-e.jpg']

expand('file{00..10..5}.jpg')
// => ['file00.jpg', 'file05.jpg', 'file10.jpg']

expand('{{A..C},{a..c}}')
// => ['A', 'B', 'C', 'a', 'b', 'c']

expand('ppp{,config,oe{,conf}}')
// => ['ppp', 'pppconfig', 'pppoe', 'pppoeconf']
```

## API

```js
var expand = require('brace-expansion');
```

### var expanded = expand(str)

Return an array of all possible and valid expansions of `str`. If none are
found, `[str]` is returned.

Valid expansions are:

```js
/^(.*,)+(.+)?$/
// {a,b,...}
```

A comma separated list of options, like `{a,b}` or `{a,{b,c}}` or `{,a,}`.

```js
/^-?\d+\.\.-?\d+(\.\.-?\d+)?$/
// {x..y[..incr]}
```

A numeric sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment.
If `x` or `y` start with a leading `0`, all the numbers will be padded
to have equal length. Negative numbers and backwards iteration work too.

```js
/^-?\d+\.\.-?\d+(\.\.-?\d+)?$/
// {x..y[..incr]}
```

An alphabetic sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment.
`x` and `y` must be exactly one character, and if given, `incr` must be a
number.

For compatibility reasons, the string `${` is not eligible for brace expansion.

## Installation

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```bash
npm install brace-expansion
```

> Bash-like brace expansion, implemented in JavaScript. Safer than other brace expansion libs, with complete support for the Bash 4.3 braces specification, without sacrificing speed.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save braces
```

## v3.0.0 Released!!

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## Why use braces?

Brace patterns make globs more powerful by adding the ability to match specific ranges and sequences of characters.

* **Accurate** - complete support for the [Bash 4.3 Brace Expansion](www.gnu.org/software/bash/) specification (passes all of the Bash braces tests)
* **[fast and performant](#benchmarks)** - Starts fast, runs fast and [scales well](#performance) as patterns increase in complexity.
* **Organized code base** - The parser and compiler are easy to maintain and update when edge cases crop up.
* **Well-tested** - Thousands of test assertions, and passes all of the Bash, minimatch, and [brace-expansion](https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion) unit tests (as of the date this was written).
* **Safer** - You shouldn't have to worry about users defining aggressive or malicious brace patterns that can break your application. Braces takes measures to prevent malicious regex that can be used for DDoS attacks (see [catastrophic backtracking](https://www.regular-expressions.info/catastrophic.html)).
* [Supports lists](#lists) - (aka "sets") `a/{b,c}/d` => `['a/b/d', 'a/c/d']`
* [Supports sequences](#sequences) - (aka "ranges") `{01..03}` => `['01', '02', '03']`
* [Supports steps](#steps) - (aka "increments") `{2..10..2}` => `['2', '4', '6', '8', '10']`
* [Supports escaping](#escaping) - To prevent evaluation of special characters.

## Usage

The main export is a function that takes one or more brace `patterns` and `options`.

```js
const braces = require('braces');
// braces(patterns[, options]);

console.log(braces(['{01..05}', '{a..e}']));
//=> ['(0[1-5])', '([a-e])']

console.log(braces(['{01..05}', '{a..e}'], { expand: true }));
//=> ['01', '02', '03', '04', '05', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```

### Brace Expansion vs. Compilation

By default, brace patterns are compiled into strings that are optimized for creating regular expressions and matching.

**Compiled**

```js
console.log(braces('a/{x,y,z}/b')); 
//=> ['a/(x|y|z)/b']
console.log(braces(['a/{01..20}/b', 'a/{1..5}/b'])); 
//=> [ 'a/(0[1-9]|1[0-9]|20)/b', 'a/([1-5])/b' ]
```

**Expanded**

Enable brace expansion by setting the `expand` option to true, or by using [braces.expand()](#expand) (returns an array similar to what you'd expect from Bash, or `echo {1..5}`, or [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)):

```js
console.log(braces('a/{x,y,z}/b', { expand: true }));
//=> ['a/x/b', 'a/y/b', 'a/z/b']

console.log(braces.expand('{01..10}'));
//=> ['01','02','03','04','05','06','07','08','09','10']
```

### Lists

Expand lists (like Bash "sets"):

```js
console.log(braces('a/{foo,bar,baz}/*.js'));
//=> ['a/(foo|bar|baz)/*.js']

console.log(braces.expand('a/{foo,bar,baz}/*.js'));
//=> ['a/foo/*.js', 'a/bar/*.js', 'a/baz/*.js']
```

### Sequences

Expand ranges of characters (like Bash "sequences"):

```js
console.log(braces.expand('{1..3}'));                // ['1', '2', '3']
console.log(braces.expand('a/{1..3}/b'));            // ['a/1/b', 'a/2/b', 'a/3/b']
console.log(braces('{a..c}', { expand: true }));     // ['a', 'b', 'c']
console.log(braces('foo/{a..c}', { expand: true })); // ['foo/a', 'foo/b', 'foo/c']

// supports zero-padded ranges
console.log(braces('a/{01..03}/b'));   //=> ['a/(0[1-3])/b']
console.log(braces('a/{001..300}/b')); //=> ['a/(0{2}[1-9]|0[1-9][0-9]|[12][0-9]{2}|300)/b']
```

See [fill-range](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/fill-range) for all available range-expansion options.

### Steppped ranges

Steps, or increments, may be used with ranges:

```js
console.log(braces.expand('{2..10..2}'));
//=> ['2', '4', '6', '8', '10']

console.log(braces('{2..10..2}'));
//=> ['(2|4|6|8|10)']
```

When the [.optimize](#optimize) method is used, or [options.optimize](#optionsoptimize) is set to true, sequences are passed to [to-regex-range](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/to-regex-range) for expansion.

### Nesting

Brace patterns may be nested. The results of each expanded string are not sorted, and left to right order is preserved.

**"Expanded" braces**

```js
console.log(braces.expand('a{b,c,/{x,y}}/e'));
//=> ['ab/e', 'ac/e', 'a/x/e', 'a/y/e']

console.log(braces.expand('a/{x,{1..5},y}/c'));
//=> ['a/x/c', 'a/1/c', 'a/2/c', 'a/3/c', 'a/4/c', 'a/5/c', 'a/y/c']
```

**"Optimized" braces**

```js
console.log(braces('a{b,c,/{x,y}}/e'));
//=> ['a(b|c|/(x|y))/e']

console.log(braces('a/{x,{1..5},y}/c'));
//=> ['a/(x|([1-5])|y)/c']
```

### Escaping

**Escaping braces**

A brace pattern will not be expanded or evaluted if _either the opening or closing brace is escaped_:

```js
console.log(braces.expand('a\\{d,c,b}e'));
//=> ['a{d,c,b}e']

console.log(braces.expand('a{d,c,b\\}e'));
//=> ['a{d,c,b}e']
```

**Escaping commas**

Commas inside braces may also be escaped:

```js
console.log(braces.expand('a{b\\,c}d'));
//=> ['a{b,c}d']

console.log(braces.expand('a{d\\,c,b}e'));
//=> ['ad,ce', 'abe']
```

**Single items**

Following bash conventions, a brace pattern is also not expanded when it contains a single character:

```js
console.log(braces.expand('a{b}c'));
//=> ['a{b}c']
```

## Options

### options.maxLength

**Type**: `Number`

**Default**: `65,536`

**Description**: Limit the length of the input string. Useful when the input string is generated or your application allows users to pass a string, et cetera.

```js
console.log(braces('a/{b,c}/d', { maxLength: 3 }));  //=> throws an error
```

### options.expand

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: Generate an "expanded" brace pattern (alternatively you can use the `braces.expand()` method, which does the same thing).

```js
console.log(braces('a/{b,c}/d', { expand: true }));
//=> [ 'a/b/d', 'a/c/d' ]
```

### options.nodupes

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: Remove duplicates from the returned array.

### options.rangeLimit

**Type**: `Number`

**Default**: `1000`

**Description**: To prevent malicious patterns from being passed by users, an error is thrown when `braces.expand()` is used or `options.expand` is true and the generated range will exceed the `rangeLimit`.

You can customize `options.rangeLimit` or set it to `Inifinity` to disable this altogether.

**Examples**

```js
// pattern exceeds the "rangeLimit", so it's optimized automatically
console.log(braces.expand('{1..1000}'));
//=> ['([1-9]|[1-9][0-9]{1,2}|1000)']

// pattern does not exceed "rangeLimit", so it's NOT optimized
console.log(braces.expand('{1..100}'));
//=> ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', '24', '25', '26', '27', '28', '29', '30', '31', '32', '33', '34', '35', '36', '37', '38', '39', '40', '41', '42', '43', '44', '45', '46', '47', '48', '49', '50', '51', '52', '53', '54', '55', '56', '57', '58', '59', '60', '61', '62', '63', '64', '65', '66', '67', '68', '69', '70', '71', '72', '73', '74', '75', '76', '77', '78', '79', '80', '81', '82', '83', '84', '85', '86', '87', '88', '89', '90', '91', '92', '93', '94', '95', '96', '97', '98', '99', '100']
```

### options.transform

**Type**: `Function`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: Customize range expansion.

**Example: Transforming non-numeric values**

```js
const alpha = braces.expand('x/{a..e}/y', {
  transform(value, index) {
    // When non-numeric values are passed, "value" is a character code.
    return 'foo/' + String.fromCharCode(value) + '-' + index;
  }
});
console.log(alpha);
//=> [ 'x/foo/a-0/y', 'x/foo/b-1/y', 'x/foo/c-2/y', 'x/foo/d-3/y', 'x/foo/e-4/y' ]
```

**Example: Transforming numeric values**

```js
const numeric = braces.expand('{1..5}', {
  transform(value) {
    // when numeric values are passed, "value" is a number
    return 'foo/' + value * 2;
  }
});
console.log(numeric); 
//=> [ 'foo/2', 'foo/4', 'foo/6', 'foo/8', 'foo/10' ]
```

### options.quantifiers

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: In regular expressions, quanitifiers can be used to specify how many times a token can be repeated. For example, `a{1,3}` will match the letter `a` one to three times.

Unfortunately, regex quantifiers happen to share the same syntax as [Bash lists](#lists)

The `quantifiers` option tells braces to detect when [regex quantifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp#quantifiers) are defined in the given pattern, and not to try to expand them as lists.

**Examples**

```js
const braces = require('braces');
console.log(braces('a/b{1,3}/{x,y,z}'));
//=> [ 'a/b(1|3)/(x|y|z)' ]
console.log(braces('a/b{1,3}/{x,y,z}', {quantifiers: true}));
//=> [ 'a/b{1,3}/(x|y|z)' ]
console.log(braces('a/b{1,3}/{x,y,z}', {quantifiers: true, expand: true}));
//=> [ 'a/b{1,3}/x', 'a/b{1,3}/y', 'a/b{1,3}/z' ]
```

### options.unescape

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: Strip backslashes that were used for escaping from the result.

## What is "brace expansion"?

Brace expansion is a type of parameter expansion that was made popular by unix shells for generating lists of strings, as well as regex-like matching when used alongside wildcards (globs).

In addition to "expansion", braces are also used for matching. In other words:

* [brace expansion](#brace-expansion) is for generating new lists
* [brace matching](#brace-matching) is for filtering existing lists

<details>
<summary><strong>More about brace expansion</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

There are two main types of brace expansion:

1. **lists**: which are defined using comma-separated values inside curly braces: `{a,b,c}`
2. **sequences**: which are defined using a starting value and an ending value, separated by two dots: `a{1..3}b`. Optionally, a third argument may be passed to define a "step" or increment to use: `a{1..100..10}b`. These are also sometimes referred to as "ranges".

Here are some example brace patterns to illustrate how they work:

**Sets**

```
{a,b,c}       => a b c
{a,b,c}{1,2}  => a1 a2 b1 b2 c1 c2
```

**Sequences**

```
{1..9}        => 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
{4..-4}       => 4 3 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3 -4
{1..20..3}    => 1 4 7 10 13 16 19
{a..j}        => a b c d e f g h i j
{j..a}        => j i h g f e d c b a
{a..z..3}     => a d g j m p s v y
```

**Combination**

Sets and sequences can be mixed together or used along with any other strings.

```
{a,b,c}{1..3}   => a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3 c1 c2 c3
foo/{a,b,c}/bar => foo/a/bar foo/b/bar foo/c/bar
```

The fact that braces can be "expanded" from relatively simple patterns makes them ideal for quickly generating test fixtures, file paths, and similar use cases.

## Brace matching

In addition to _expansion_, brace patterns are also useful for performing regular-expression-like matching.

For example, the pattern `foo/{1..3}/bar` would match any of following strings:

```
foo/1/bar
foo/2/bar
foo/3/bar
```

But not:

```
baz/1/qux
baz/2/qux
baz/3/qux
```

Braces can also be combined with [glob patterns](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/micromatch) to perform more advanced wildcard matching. For example, the pattern `*/{1..3}/*` would match any of following strings:

```
foo/1/bar
foo/2/bar
foo/3/bar
baz/1/qux
baz/2/qux
baz/3/qux
```

## Brace matching pitfalls

Although brace patterns offer a user-friendly way of matching ranges or sets of strings, there are also some major disadvantages and potential risks you should be aware of.

### tldr

**"brace bombs"**

* brace expansion can eat up a huge amount of processing resources
* as brace patterns increase _linearly in size_, the system resources required to expand the pattern increase exponentially
* users can accidentally (or intentially) exhaust your system's resources resulting in the equivalent of a DoS attack (bonus: no programming knowledge is required!)

For a more detailed explanation with examples, see the [geometric complexity](#geometric-complexity) section.

### The solution

Jump to the [performance section](#performance) to see how Braces solves this problem in comparison to other libraries.

### Geometric complexity

At minimum, brace patterns with sets limited to two elements have quadradic or `O(n^2)` complexity. But the complexity of the algorithm increases exponentially as the number of sets, _and elements per set_, increases, which is `O(n^c)`.

For example, the following sets demonstrate quadratic (`O(n^2)`) complexity:

```
{1,2}{3,4}      => (2X2)    => 13 14 23 24
{1,2}{3,4}{5,6} => (2X2X2)  => 135 136 145 146 235 236 245 246
```

But add an element to a set, and we get a n-fold Cartesian product with `O(n^c)` complexity:

```
{1,2,3}{4,5,6}{7,8,9} => (3X3X3) => 147 148 149 157 158 159 167 168 169 247 248 
                                    249 257 258 259 267 268 269 347 348 349 357 
                                    358 359 367 368 369
```

Now, imagine how this complexity grows given that each element is a n-tuple:

```
{1..100}{1..100}         => (100X100)     => 10,000 elements (38.4 kB)
{1..100}{1..100}{1..100} => (100X100X100) => 1,000,000 elements (5.76 MB)
```

Although these examples are clearly contrived, they demonstrate how brace patterns can quickly grow out of control.

## Performance

Braces is not only screaming fast, it's also more accurate the other brace expansion libraries.

### Better algorithms

Fortunately there is a solution to the ["brace bomb" problem](#brace-matching-pitfalls): _don't expand brace patterns into an array when they're used for matching_.

Instead, convert the pattern into an optimized regular expression. This is easier said than done, and braces is the only library that does this currently.

**The proof is in the numbers**

Minimatch gets exponentially slower as patterns increase in complexity, braces does not. The following results were generated using `braces()` and `minimatch.braceExpand()`, respectively.

| **Pattern**                 | **braces**         | **[minimatch][]**            |

| `{1..10}`                   | `10 B` (533μs)     | `20 B` (37μs)                |
| `{1..3}`                    | `7 B` (190μs)      | `5 B` (27μs)                 |

### Faster algorithms

When you need expansion, braces is still much faster.

_(the following results were generated using `braces.expand()` and `minimatch.braceExpand()`, respectively)_

| **Pattern**     | **braces**                  | **[minimatch][]**            |
| ---             | ---                         | ---                          |
| `{1..10000000}` | `78.89 MB` (2s 698ms 642μs) | `78.89 MB` (18s 601ms 974μs) |
| `{1..1000000}`  | `6.89 MB` (458ms 576μs)     | `6.89 MB` (1s 491ms 621μs)   |
| `{1..100000}`   | `588.89 kB` (20ms 728μs)    | `588.89 kB` (156ms 919μs)    |
| `{1..10000}`    | `48.89 kB` (2ms 202μs)      | `48.89 kB` (13ms 641μs)      |
| `{1..1000}`     | `3.89 kB` (1ms 796μs)       | `3.89 kB` (1ms 958μs)        |
| `{1..100}`      | `291 B` (424μs)             | `291 B` (211μs)              |
| `{1..10}`       | `20 B` (487μs)              | `20 B` (72μs)                |
| `{1..3}`        | `5 B` (166μs)               | `5 B` (27μs)                 |

})();
```

## API

The methods returns a promise that resolves when the `end` event fires on the stream, indicating that there is no more data to be read. The stream is switched to flowing mode.

### getStream(stream, options?)

Get the `stream` as a string.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### encoding

Type: `string`\
Default: `'utf8'`

[Encoding](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer) of the incoming stream.

##### maxBuffer

Type: `number`\
Default: `Infinity`

Maximum length of the returned string. If it exceeds this value before the stream ends, the promise will be rejected with a `getStream.MaxBufferError` error.

### getStream.buffer(stream, options?)

Get the `stream` as a buffer.

It honors the `maxBuffer` option as above, but it refers to byte length rather than string length.

### getStream.array(stream, options?)

Get the `stream` as an array of values.

It honors both the `maxBuffer` and `encoding` options. The behavior changes slightly based on the encoding chosen:

- When `encoding` is unset, it assumes an [object mode stream](https://nodesource.com/blog/understanding-object-streams/) and collects values emitted from `stream` unmodified. In this case `maxBuffer` refers to the number of items in the array (not the sum of their sizes).

- When `encoding` is set to `buffer`, it collects an array of buffers. `maxBuffer` refers to the summed byte lengths of every buffer in the array.

- When `encoding` is set to anything else, it collects an array of strings. `maxBuffer` refers to the summed character lengths of every string in the array.

## Errors

If the input stream emits an `error` event, the promise will be rejected with the error. The buffered data will be attached to the `bufferedData` property of the error.

```js
(async () => {
	try {
		await getStream(streamThatErrorsAtTheEnd('unicorn'));
	} catch (error) {
		console.log(error.bufferedData);
		//=> 'unicorn'
	}
})()
```

## FAQ

### How is this different from [`concat-stream`](https://github.com/maxogden/concat-stream)?

This module accepts a stream instead of being one and returns a promise instead of using a callback. The API is simpler and it only supports returning a string, buffer, or array. It doesn't have a fragile type inference. You explicitly choose what you want. And it doesn't depend on the huge `readable-stream` package.

# cacheable-request

> Wrap native HTTP requests with RFC compliant cache support

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/cacheable-request.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/cacheable-request)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/cacheable-request/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/cacheable-request?branch=master)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/cacheable-request.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cacheable-request)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cacheable-request.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cacheable-request)

[RFC 7234](http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html) compliant HTTP caching for native Node.js HTTP/HTTPS requests. Caching works out of the box in memory or is easily pluggable with a wide range of storage adapters.

**Note:** This is a low level wrapper around the core HTTP modules, it's not a high level request library.

## Features

- Only stores cacheable responses as defined by RFC 7234
- Fresh cache entries are served directly from cache
- Stale cache entries are revalidated with `If-None-Match`/`If-Modified-Since` headers
- 304 responses from revalidation requests use cached body
- Updates `Age` header on cached responses
- Can completely bypass cache on a per request basis
- In memory cache by default
- Official support for Redis, MongoDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL storage adapters
- Easily plug in your own or third-party storage adapters
- If DB connection fails, cache is automatically bypassed ([disabled by default](#optsautomaticfailover))
- Adds cache support to any existing HTTP code with minimal changes
- Uses [http-cache-semantics](https://github.com/pornel/http-cache-semantics) internally for HTTP RFC 7234 compliance

## Install

```shell
npm install cacheable-request
```

## Usage

```js
const http = require('http');
const CacheableRequest = require('cacheable-request');

// Then instead of
const req = http.request('http://example.com', cb);
req.end();

// You can do
const cacheableRequest = new CacheableRequest(http.request);
const cacheReq = cacheableRequest('http://example.com', cb);
cacheReq.on('request', req => req.end());
// Future requests to 'example.com' will be returned from cache if still valid

// You pass in any other http.request API compatible method to be wrapped with cache support:
const cacheableRequest = new CacheableRequest(https.request);
const cacheableRequest = new CacheableRequest(electron.net);
```

## Storage Adapters

`cacheable-request` uses [Keyv](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv) to support a wide range of storage adapters.

For example, to use Redis as a cache backend, you just need to install the official Redis Keyv storage adapter:

```
npm install @keyv/redis
```

And then you can pass `CacheableRequest` your connection string:

```js
const cacheableRequest = new CacheableRequest(http.request, 'redis://user:pass@localhost:6379');
```

[View all official Keyv storage adapters.](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv#official-storage-adapters)

Keyv also supports anything that follows the Map API so it's easy to write your own storage adapter or use a third-party solution.

e.g The following are all valid storage adapters

```js
const storageAdapter = new Map();
// or
const storageAdapter = require('./my-storage-adapter');
// or
const QuickLRU = require('quick-lru');
const storageAdapter = new QuickLRU({ maxSize: 1000 });

const cacheableRequest = new CacheableRequest(http.request, storageAdapter);
```

View the [Keyv docs](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv) for more information on how to use storage adapters.

## API

### new cacheableRequest(request, [storageAdapter])

Returns the provided request function wrapped with cache support.

#### request

Type: `function`

Request function to wrap with cache support. Should be [`http.request`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_request_options_callback) or a similar API compatible request function.

#### storageAdapter

Type: `Keyv storage adapter`<br>
Default: `new Map()`

A [Keyv](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv) storage adapter instance, or connection string if using with an official Keyv storage adapter.

### Instance

#### cacheableRequest(opts, [cb])

Returns an event emitter.

##### opts

Type: `object`, `string`

- Any of the default request functions options.
- Any [`http-cache-semantics`](https://github.com/kornelski/http-cache-semantics#constructor-options) options.
- Any of the following:

###### opts.cache

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

If the cache should be used. Setting this to false will completely bypass the cache for the current request.

###### opts.strictTtl

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

If set to `true` once a cached resource has expired it is deleted and will have to be re-requested.

If set to `false` (default), after a cached resource's TTL expires it is kept in the cache and will be revalidated on the next request with `If-None-Match`/`If-Modified-Since` headers.

###### opts.maxTtl

Type: `number`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Limits TTL. The `number` represents milliseconds.

###### opts.automaticFailover

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

When set to `true`, if the DB connection fails we will automatically fallback to a network request. DB errors will still be emitted to notify you of the problem even though the request callback may succeed.

###### opts.forceRefresh

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Forces refreshing the cache. If the response could be retrieved from the cache, it will perform a new request and override the cache instead.

##### cb

Type: `function`

The callback function which will receive the response as an argument.

The response can be either a [Node.js HTTP response stream](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) or a [responselike object](https://github.com/lukechilds/responselike). The response will also have a `fromCache` property set with a boolean value.

##### .on('request', request)

`request` event to get the request object of the request.

**Note:** This event will only fire if an HTTP request is actually made, not when a response is retrieved from cache. However, you should always handle the `request` event to end the request and handle any potential request errors.

##### .on('response', response)

`response` event to get the response object from the HTTP request or cache.

##### .on('error', error)

`error` event emitted in case of an error with the cache.

Errors emitted here will be an instance of `CacheableRequest.RequestError` or `CacheableRequest.CacheError`. You will only ever receive a `RequestError` if the request function throws (normally caused by invalid user input). Normal request errors should be handled inside the `request` event.

To properly handle all error scenarios you should use the following pattern:

```js
cacheableRequest('example.com', cb)
  .on('error', err => {
    if (err instanceof CacheableRequest.CacheError) {
      handleCacheError(err); // Cache error
    } else if (err instanceof CacheableRequest.RequestError) {
      handleRequestError(err); // Request function thrown
    }
  })
  .on('request', req => {
    req.on('error', handleRequestError); // Request error emitted
    req.end();
  });
```

**Note:** Database connection errors are emitted here, however `cacheable-request` will attempt to re-request the resource and bypass the cache on a connection error. Therefore a database connection error doesn't necessarily mean the request won't be fulfilled.

### [Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/check-links/readme.md](Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/check-links/readme.md)
# check-links

> Robustly checks an array of URLs for liveness.

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/check-links.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/check-links) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/transitive-bullshit/check-links.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/transitive-bullshit/check-links) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

For each URL, it first attempts an HTTP HEAD request, and if that fails it will attempt
an HTTP GET request, retrying several times by default with exponential falloff.

This module handles concurrency and retry logic so you can check the status of thousands
of links quickly and robustly.

## Install

This module requires `node >= 8`.

```bash
npm install --save check-links
```

## Usage

```js
const checkLinks = require('check-links')

const results = await checkLinks([
  'https://foo.com',
  'https://404.com',
])

results['https://foo.com'] // { status: 'alive', statusCode: 200 }
results['https://404.com'] // { status: 'dead', statusCode: 404 }

// example using a custom timeout and retry count
const results2 = await checkLinks([
  'https://foo.com',
  'https://404.com',
], {
  timeout: 30000,
  retry: 1
})
```

-   Supports HTTP and HTTPS urls.
-   Defaults to a 30 second timeout per HTTP request with 2 retries.
-   Defaults to a Mac OS Chrome `user-agent`.
-   Defaults to following redirects.

## API

<!-- Generated by documentation.js. Update this documentation by updating the source code. -->

### [checkLinks](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/check-links/blob/cf5fbcf0fc0bd150097034887b7c132384794549/index.js#L34-L51)

Robustly checks an array of URLs for liveness.

For each URL, it first attempts an HTTP HEAD request, and if that fails it will attempt
an HTTP GET request, retrying several times by default with exponential falloff.

Returns a `Map<String, LivenessResult>` that maps each input URL to an object
containing `status` and possibly `statusCode`.

`LivenessResult.status` will be one of the following:

-   `alive` if the URL is reachable (2XX status code)
-   `dead` if the URL is not reachable
-   `invalid` if the URL was parsed as invalid or used an unsupported protocol

`LivenessResult.statusCode` will contain an integer HTTP status code if that URL resolved
properly.

Type: `function (urls, opts)`

-   `urls` **[array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)>** Array of urls to test
-   `opts` **[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)?** Optional configuration options (any extra options are passed to [got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got#options))
    -   `opts.concurrency` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** Maximum number of urls to resolve concurrently (optional, default `8`)

# cliui

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yargs/cliui.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/yargs/cliui)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/yargs/cliui/badge.svg?branch=)](https://coveralls.io/r/yargs/cliui?branch=)
[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cliui.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cliui)
[![Standard Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-standard%20version-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version)

easily create complex multi-column command-line-interfaces.

## Example

```js
var ui = require('cliui')()

ui.div('Usage: $0 [command] [options]')

ui.div({
  text: 'Options:',
  padding: [2, 0, 2, 0]
})

ui.div(
  {
    text: "-f, --file",
    width: 20,
    padding: [0, 4, 0, 4]
  },
  {
    text: "the file to load." +
      chalk.green("(if this description is long it wraps).")
    ,
    width: 20
  },
  {
    text: chalk.red("[required]"),
    align: 'right'
  }
)

console.log(ui.toString())
```

<img width="500" src="screenshot.png">

## Layout DSL

cliui exposes a simple layout DSL:

If you create a single `ui.div`, passing a string rather than an
object:

* `\n`: characters will be interpreted as new rows.
* `\t`: characters will be interpreted as new columns.
* `\s`: characters will be interpreted as padding.

**as an example...**

```js
var ui = require('./')({
  width: 60
})

ui.div(
  'Usage: node ./bin/foo.js\n' +
  '  <regex>\t  provide a regex\n' +
  '  <glob>\t  provide a glob\t [required]'
)

console.log(ui.toString())
```

**will output:**

```shell
Usage: node ./bin/foo.js
  <regex>  provide a regex
  <glob>   provide a glob          [required]
```

## Methods

```js
cliui = require('cliui')
```

### cliui({width: integer})

Specify the maximum width of the UI being generated.
If no width is provided, cliui will try to get the current window's width and use it, and if that doesn't work, width will be set to `80`.

### cliui({wrap: boolean})

Enable or disable the wrapping of text in a column.

### cliui.div(column, column, column)

Create a row with any number of columns, a column
can either be a string, or an object with the following
options:

* **text:** some text to place in the column.
* **width:** the width of a column.
* **align:** alignment, `right` or `center`.
* **padding:** `[top, right, bottom, left]`.
* **border:** should a border be placed around the div?

### cliui.span(column, column, column)

Similar to `div`, except the next row will be appended without
a new line being created.

### cliui.resetOutput()

Resets the UI elements of the current cliui instance, maintaining the values
set for `width` and `wrap`.

# clone-response

> Clone a Node.js HTTP response stream

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/clone-response.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/clone-response)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/clone-response/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/clone-response?branch=master)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/clone-response.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clone-response)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/clone-response.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clone-response)

Returns a new stream and copies over all properties and methods from the original response giving you a complete duplicate.

This is useful in situations where you need to consume the response stream but also want to pass an unconsumed stream somewhere else to be consumed later.

## Install

```shell
npm install --save clone-response
```

## Usage

```js
const http = require('http');
const cloneResponse = require('clone-response');

http.get('http://example.com', response => {
  const clonedResponse = cloneResponse(response);
  response.pipe(process.stdout);

  setImmediate(() => {
    // The response stream has already been consumed by the time this executes,
    // however the cloned response stream is still available.
    doSomethingWithResponse(clonedResponse);
  });
});
```

Please bear in mind that the process of cloning a stream consumes it. However, you can consume a stream multiple times in the same tick, therefore allowing you to create multiple clones. e.g:

```js
const clone1 = cloneResponse(response);
const clone2 = cloneResponse(response);
// response can still be consumed in this tick but cannot be consumed if passed
// into any async callbacks. clone1 and clone2 can be passed around and be
// consumed in the future.
```

## API

### cloneResponse(response)

Returns a clone of the passed in response.

#### response

Type: `stream`

A [Node.js HTTP response stream](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) to clone.

# color-convert

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Qix-/color-convert.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Qix-/color-convert)

Color-convert is a color conversion library for JavaScript and node.
It converts all ways between `rgb`, `hsl`, `hsv`, `hwb`, `cmyk`, `ansi`, `ansi16`, `hex` strings, and CSS `keyword`s (will round to closest):

```js
var convert = require('color-convert');

convert.rgb.hsl(140, 200, 100);             // [96, 48, 59]
convert.keyword.rgb('blue');                // [0, 0, 255]

var rgbChannels = convert.rgb.channels;     // 3
var cmykChannels = convert.cmyk.channels;   // 4
var ansiChannels = convert.ansi16.channels; // 1
```

# Install

```console
$ npm install color-convert
```

# API

Simply get the property of the _from_ and _to_ conversion that you're looking for.

All functions have a rounded and unrounded variant. By default, return values are rounded. To get the unrounded (raw) results, simply tack on `.raw` to the function.

All 'from' functions have a hidden property called `.channels` that indicates the number of channels the function expects (not including alpha).

```js
var convert = require('color-convert');

// Hex to LAB
convert.hex.lab('DEADBF');         // [ 76, 21, -2 ]
convert.hex.lab.raw('DEADBF');     // [ 75.56213190997677, 20.653827952644754, -2.290532499330533 ]

// RGB to CMYK
convert.rgb.cmyk(167, 255, 4);     // [ 35, 0, 98, 0 ]
convert.rgb.cmyk.raw(167, 255, 4); // [ 34.509803921568626, 0, 98.43137254901961, 0 ]
```

### Arrays
All functions that accept multiple arguments also support passing an array.

Note that this does **not** apply to functions that convert from a color that only requires one value (e.g. `keyword`, `ansi256`, `hex`, etc.)

```js
var convert = require('color-convert');

convert.rgb.hex(123, 45, 67);      // '7B2D43'
convert.rgb.hex([123, 45, 67]);    // '7B2D43'
```

## Routing

Conversions that don't have an _explicitly_ defined conversion (in [conversions.js](conversions.js)), but can be converted by means of sub-conversions (e.g. XYZ -> **RGB** -> CMYK), are automatically routed together. This allows just about any color model supported by `color-convert` to be converted to any other model, so long as a sub-conversion path exists. This is also true for conversions requiring more than one step in between (e.g. LCH -> **LAB** -> **XYZ** -> **RGB** -> Hex).

Keep in mind that extensive conversions _may_ result in a loss of precision, and exist only to be complete. For a list of "direct" (single-step) conversions, see [conversions.js](conversions.js).

## Usage

By popular demand, `colors` now ships with two types of usages!

The super nifty way

```js
var colors = require('colors');

console.log('hello'.green); // outputs green text
console.log('i like cake and pies'.underline.red) // outputs red underlined text
console.log('inverse the color'.inverse); // inverses the color
console.log('OMG Rainbows!'.rainbow); // rainbow
console.log('Run the trap'.trap); // Drops the bass

```

or a slightly less nifty way which doesn't extend `String.prototype`

```js
var colors = require('colors/safe');

console.log(colors.green('hello')); // outputs green text
console.log(colors.red.underline('i like cake and pies')) // outputs red underlined text
console.log(colors.inverse('inverse the color')); // inverses the color
console.log(colors.rainbow('OMG Rainbows!')); // rainbow
console.log(colors.trap('Run the trap')); // Drops the bass

```

I prefer the first way. Some people seem to be afraid of extending `String.prototype` and prefer the second way. 

If you are writing good code you will never have an issue with the first approach. If you really don't want to touch `String.prototype`, the second usage will not touch `String` native object.

## Enabling/Disabling Colors

The package will auto-detect whether your terminal can use colors and enable/disable accordingly. When colors are disabled, the color functions do nothing. You can override this with a command-line flag:

```bash
node myapp.js --no-color
node myapp.js --color=false

node myapp.js --color
node myapp.js --color=true
node myapp.js --color=always

FORCE_COLOR=1 node myapp.js
```

Or in code:

```javascript
var colors = require('colors');
colors.enable();
colors.disable();
```

## Console.log [string substitution](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data)

```js
var name = 'Marak';
console.log(colors.green('Hello %s'), name);
// outputs -> 'Hello Marak'
```

## Custom themes

### Using standard API

```js

var colors = require('colors');

colors.setTheme({
  silly: 'rainbow',
  input: 'grey',
  verbose: 'cyan',
  prompt: 'grey',
  info: 'green',
  data: 'grey',
  help: 'cyan',
  warn: 'yellow',
  debug: 'blue',
  error: 'red'
});

// outputs red text
console.log("this is an error".error);

// outputs yellow text
console.log("this is a warning".warn);
```

### Using string safe API

```js
var colors = require('colors/safe');

// set single property
var error = colors.red;
error('this is red');

// set theme
colors.setTheme({
  silly: 'rainbow',
  input: 'grey',
  verbose: 'cyan',
  prompt: 'grey',
  info: 'green',
  data: 'grey',
  help: 'cyan',
  warn: 'yellow',
  debug: 'blue',
  error: 'red'
});

// outputs red text
console.log(colors.error("this is an error"));

// outputs yellow text
console.log(colors.warn("this is a warning"));

```

### Combining Colors

```javascript
var colors = require('colors');

colors.setTheme({
  custom: ['red', 'underline']
});

console.log('test'.custom);
```

*Protip: There is a secret undocumented style in `colors`. If you find the style you can summon him.*

### [Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/commander/CHANGELOG.md](Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/commander/CHANGELOG.md)
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). (Format adopted after v3.0.0.)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

- configuration support in `addCommand()` for `hidden` and `isDefault` ([#1232])

### Fixed

- omit masked help flags from the displayed help ([#645], [#1247])
- remove old short help flag when change help flags using `helpOption` ([#1248])

- rename `.command()` configuration `noHelp` to `hidden` (but not remove old support) ([#1232])
- improvements to documentation
- update dependencies
- update tested versions of node
- eliminate lint errors in TypeScript ([#1208])

## [5.0.0] (2020-03-14)

### Added

* support for nested commands with action-handlers ([#1] [#764] [#1149])
* `.addCommand()` for adding a separately configured command ([#764] [#1149])
* allow a non-executable to be set as the default command ([#742] [#1149])
* implicit help command when there are subcommands (previously only if executables) ([#1149])
* customise implicit help command with `.addHelpCommand()` ([#1149])
* display error message for unknown subcommand, by default ([#432] [#1088] [#1149])
* display help for missing subcommand, by default ([#1088] [#1149])
* combined short options as single argument may include boolean flags and value flag and value (e.g. `-a -b -p 80` can be written as `-abp80`) ([#1145])
* `.parseOption()` includes short flag and long flag expansions ([#1145])
* `.helpInformation()` returns help text as a string, previously a private routine ([#1169])
* `.parse()` implicitly uses `process.argv` if arguments not specified ([#1172])
* optionally specify where `.parse()` arguments "from", if not following node conventions ([#512] [#1172])
* suggest help option along with unknown command error ([#1179])
* TypeScript definition for `commands` property of `Command` ([#1184])
* export `program` property ([#1195])
* `createCommand` factory method to simplify subclassing ([#1191])

### Fixed

* preserve argument order in subcommands ([#508] [#962] [#1138])
* do not emit `command:*` for executable subcommands ([#809] [#1149])
* action handler called whether or not there are non-option arguments ([#1062] [#1149])
* combining option short flag and value in single argument now works for subcommands ([#1145])
* only add implicit help command when it will not conflict with other uses of argument ([#1153] [#1149])
* implicit help command works with command aliases ([#948] [#1149])
* options are validated whether or not there is an action handler ([#1149])

### Changed

* *Breaking* `.args` contains command arguments with just recognised options removed ([#1032] [#1138])
* *Breaking* display error if required argument for command is missing ([#995] [#1149])
* tighten TypeScript definition of custom option processing function passed to `.option()` ([#1119])
* *Breaking* `.allowUnknownOption()` ([#802] [#1138])
  * unknown options included in arguments passed to command action handler
  * unknown options included in `.args`
* only recognised option short flags and long flags are expanded (e.g. `-ab` or `--foo=bar`) ([#1145])
* *Breaking* `.parseOptions()` ([#1138])
  * `args` in returned result renamed `operands` and does not include anything after first unknown option
  * `unknown` in returned result has arguments after first unknown option including operands, not just options and values
* *Breaking* `.on('command:*', callback)` and other command events passed (changed) results from `.parseOptions`, i.e. operands and unknown  ([#1138])
* refactor Option from prototype to class ([#1133])
* refactor Command from prototype to class ([#1159])
* changes to error handling ([#1165])
  * throw for author error, not just display message
  * preflight for variadic error
  * add tips to missing subcommand executable
* TypeScript fluent return types changed to be more subclass friendly, return `this` rather than `Command` ([#1180])
* `.parseAsync` returns `Promise<this>` to be consistent with `.parse()` ([#1180])
* update dependencies

### Removed

* removed EventEmitter from TypeScript definition for Command, eliminating implicit peer dependency on `@types/node` ([#1146])
* removed private function `normalize` (the functionality has been integrated into `parseOptions`) ([#1145])
* `parseExpectedArgs` is now private ([#1149])

### Migration Tips

If you use `.on('command:*')` or more complicated tests to detect an unrecognised subcommand, you may be able to delete the code and rely on the default behaviour.

If you use `program.args` or more complicated tests to detect a missing subcommand, you may be able to delete the code and rely on the default behaviour.

If you use `.command('*')` to add a default command, you may be be able to switch to `isDefault:true` with a named command.

### Migration Tips

#### Testing for no arguments

If you were previously using code like:

```js
if (!program.args.length) ...
```

a partial replacement is:

```js
if (program.rawArgs.length < 3) ...
```

## [3.0.0] / 2019-08-08

* Add option to specify executable file name ([#999])
  * e.g. `.command('clone', 'clone description', { executableFile: 'myClone' })`
* Change docs for `.command` to contrast action handler vs git-style executable. ([#938] [#990])
* **Breaking** Change TypeScript to use overloaded function for `.command`. ([#938] [#990])
* Change to use straight quotes around strings in error messages (like 'this' instead of `this') ([#915])
* Add TypeScript "reference types" for node ([#974])
* Add support for hyphen as an option argument in subcommands ([#697])
* Add support for a short option flag and its value to be concatenated for action handler subcommands ([#599])
  * e.g. `-p 80` can also be supplied as `-p80`
* Add executable arguments to spawn in win32, for git-style executables ([#611])
  * e.g. `node --harmony myCommand.js clone`
* Add parent command as prefix of subcommand in help ([#980])
* Add optional custom description to `.version` ([#963])
  * e.g. `program.version('0.0.1', '-v, --vers', 'output the current version')`
* Add `.helpOption(flags, description)` routine to customise help flags and description ([#963])
  * e.g. `.helpOption('-e, --HELP', 'read more information')`
* Fix behavior of --no-* options ([#795])
  * can now define both `--foo` and `--no-foo`
  * **Breaking** custom event listeners: `--no-foo` on cli now emits `option:no-foo` (previously `option:foo`)
  * **Breaking** default value: defining `--no-foo` after defining `--foo` leaves the default value unchanged (previously set it to false)
  * allow boolean default value, such as from environment ([#987])
* Increment inspector port for spawned subcommands ([#991])
  * e.g. `node --inspect myCommand.js clone`

### Migration Tips

The custom event for a negated option like `--no-foo` is `option:no-foo` (previously `option:foo`).

```js
program
  .option('--no-foo')
  .on('option:no-foo', () => {
    console.log('removing foo');
  });
```

When using TypeScript, adding a command does not allow an explicit `undefined` for an unwanted executable description (e.g
for a command with an action handler).

```js
program
  .command('action1', undefined, { noHelp: true }) // No longer valid
  .command('action2', { noHelp: true }) // Correct
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install commander
```

## Declaring _program_ variable

Commander exports a global object which is convenient for quick programs.
This is used in the examples in this README for brevity.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');
program.version('0.0.1');
```

For larger programs which may use commander in multiple ways, including unit testing, it is better to create a local Command object to use.

 ```js
 const { Command } = require('commander');
 const program = new Command();
 program.version('0.0.1');
 ```

## Options

Options are defined with the `.option()` method, also serving as documentation for the options. Each option can have a short flag (single character) and a long name, separated by a comma or space or vertical bar ('|').

The options can be accessed as properties on the Command object. Multi-word options such as "--template-engine" are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc. See also optional new behaviour to [avoid name clashes](#avoiding-option-name-clashes).

Multiple short flags may optionally be combined in a single argument following the dash: boolean flags, the last flag may take a value, and the value.
For example `-a -b -p 80` may be written as `-ab -p80` or even `-abp80`.

You can use `--` to indicate the end of the options, and any remaining arguments will be used without being interpreted.
This is particularly useful for passing options through to another
command, like: `do -- git --version`.

Options on the command line are not positional, and can be specified before or after other command arguments.

### Common option types, boolean and value

The two most used option types are a boolean flag, and an option which takes a value (declared using angle brackets). Both are `undefined` unless specified on command line.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .option('-d, --debug', 'output extra debugging')
  .option('-s, --small', 'small pizza size')
  .option('-p, --pizza-type <type>', 'flavour of pizza');

program.parse(process.argv);

if (program.debug) console.log(program.opts());
console.log('pizza details:');
if (program.small) console.log('- small pizza size');
if (program.pizzaType) console.log(`- ${program.pizzaType}`);
```

```bash
$ pizza-options -d
{ debug: true, small: undefined, pizzaType: undefined }
pizza details:
$ pizza-options -p
error: option '-p, --pizza-type <type>' argument missing
$ pizza-options -ds -p vegetarian
{ debug: true, small: true, pizzaType: 'vegetarian' }
pizza details:
- small pizza size
- vegetarian
$ pizza-options --pizza-type=cheese
pizza details:
- cheese
```

`program.parse(arguments)` processes the arguments, leaving any args not consumed by the program options in the `program.args` array.

### Default option value

You can specify a default value for an option which takes a value.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .option('-c, --cheese <type>', 'add the specified type of cheese', 'blue');

program.parse(process.argv);

console.log(`cheese: ${program.cheese}`);
```

```bash
$ pizza-options
cheese: blue
$ pizza-options --cheese stilton
cheese: stilton
```

### Other option types, negatable boolean and flag|value

You can specify a boolean option long name with a leading `no-` to set the option value to false when used.
Defined alone this also makes the option true by default.

If you define `--foo` first, adding `--no-foo` does not change the default value from what it would
otherwise be. You can specify a default boolean value for a boolean flag and it can be overridden on command line.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .option('--no-sauce', 'Remove sauce')
  .option('--cheese <flavour>', 'cheese flavour', 'mozzarella')
  .option('--no-cheese', 'plain with no cheese')
  .parse(process.argv);

const sauceStr = program.sauce ? 'sauce' : 'no sauce';
const cheeseStr = (program.cheese === false) ? 'no cheese' : `${program.cheese} cheese`;
console.log(`You ordered a pizza with ${sauceStr} and ${cheeseStr}`);
```

```bash
$ pizza-options
You ordered a pizza with sauce and mozzarella cheese
$ pizza-options --sauce
error: unknown option '--sauce'
$ pizza-options --cheese=blue
You ordered a pizza with sauce and blue cheese
$ pizza-options --no-sauce --no-cheese
You ordered a pizza with no sauce and no cheese
```

You can specify an option which functions as a flag but may also take a value (declared using square brackets).

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .option('-c, --cheese [type]', 'Add cheese with optional type');

program.parse(process.argv);

if (program.cheese === undefined) console.log('no cheese');
else if (program.cheese === true) console.log('add cheese');
else console.log(`add cheese type ${program.cheese}`);
```

```bash
$ pizza-options
no cheese
$ pizza-options --cheese
add cheese
$ pizza-options --cheese mozzarella
add cheese type mozzarella
```

### Custom option processing

You may specify a function to do custom processing of option values. The callback function receives two parameters, the user specified value and the
previous value for the option. It returns the new value for the option.

This allows you to coerce the option value to the desired type, or accumulate values, or do entirely custom processing.

You can optionally specify the default/starting value for the option after the function.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

function myParseInt(value, dummyPrevious) {
  // parseInt takes a string and an optional radix
  return parseInt(value);
}

function increaseVerbosity(dummyValue, previous) {
  return previous + 1;
}

function collect(value, previous) {
  return previous.concat([value]);
}

function commaSeparatedList(value, dummyPrevious) {
  return value.split(',');
}

program
  .option('-f, --float <number>', 'float argument', parseFloat)
  .option('-i, --integer <number>', 'integer argument', myParseInt)
  .option('-v, --verbose', 'verbosity that can be increased', increaseVerbosity, 0)
  .option('-c, --collect <value>', 'repeatable value', collect, [])
  .option('-l, --list <items>', 'comma separated list', commaSeparatedList)
;

program.parse(process.argv);

if (program.float !== undefined) console.log(`float: ${program.float}`);
if (program.integer !== undefined) console.log(`integer: ${program.integer}`);
if (program.verbose > 0) console.log(`verbosity: ${program.verbose}`);
if (program.collect.length > 0) console.log(program.collect);
if (program.list !== undefined) console.log(program.list);
```

```bash
$ custom -f 1e2
float: 100
$ custom --integer 2
integer: 2
$ custom -v -v -v
verbose: 3
$ custom -c a -c b -c c
[ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]
$ custom --list x,y,z
[ 'x', 'y', 'z' ]
```

### Required option

You may specify a required (mandatory) option using `.requiredOption`. The option must have a value after parsing, usually specified on the command line, or perhaps from a default value (say from environment). The method is otherwise the same as `.option` in format, taking flags and description, and optional default value or custom processing.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .requiredOption('-c, --cheese <type>', 'pizza must have cheese');

program.parse(process.argv);
```

```bash
$ pizza
error: required option '-c, --cheese <type>' not specified
```

### Version option

The optional `version` method adds handling for displaying the command version. The default option flags are `-V` and `--version`, and when present the command prints the version number and exits.

```js
program.version('0.0.1');
```

```bash
$ ./examples/pizza -V
0.0.1
```

You may change the flags and description by passing additional parameters to the `version` method, using
the same syntax for flags as the `option` method. The version flags can be named anything, but a long name is required.

```js
program.version('0.0.1', '-v, --vers', 'output the current version');
```

## Commands

You can specify (sub)commands using `.command()` or `.addCommand()`. There are two ways these can be implemented: using an action handler attached to the command, or as a stand-alone executable file (described in more detail later). The subcommands may be nested ([example](./examples/nestedCommands.js)).

In the first parameter to `.command()` you specify the command name and any command arguments. The arguments may be `<required>` or `[optional]`, and the last argument may also be `variadic...`.

You can use `.addCommand()` to add an already configured subcommand to the program.

For example:

```js
// Command implemented using action handler (description is supplied separately to `.command`)
// Returns new command for configuring.
program
  .command('clone <source> [destination]')
  .description('clone a repository into a newly created directory')
  .action((source, destination) => {
    console.log('clone command called');
  });

// Command implemented using stand-alone executable file (description is second parameter to `.command`)
// Returns `this` for adding more commands.
program
  .command('start <service>', 'start named service')
  .command('stop [service]', 'stop named service, or all if no name supplied');

// Command prepared separately.
// Returns `this` for adding more commands.
program
  .addCommand(build.makeBuildCommand());
```

Configuration options can be passed with the call to `.command()` and `.addCommand()`. Specifying `true` for `opts.hidden` will remove the command from the generated help output. Specifying `true` for `opts.isDefault` will run the subcommand if no other subcommand is specified ([example](./examples/defaultCommand.js)).

### Specify the argument syntax

You use `.arguments` to specify the arguments for the top-level command, and for subcommands they are usually included in the `.command` call. Angled brackets (e.g. `<required>`) indicate required input. Square brackets (e.g. `[optional]`) indicate optional input.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .arguments('<cmd> [env]')
  .action(function (cmd, env) {
    cmdValue = cmd;
    envValue = env;
  });

program.parse(process.argv);

if (typeof cmdValue === 'undefined') {
  console.error('no command given!');
  process.exit(1);
}
console.log('command:', cmdValue);
console.log('environment:', envValue || "no environment given");
```

 The last argument of a command can be variadic, and only the last argument.  To make an argument variadic you
 append `...` to the argument name. For example:

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .command('rmdir <dir> [otherDirs...]')
  .action(function (dir, otherDirs) {
    console.log('rmdir %s', dir);
    if (otherDirs) {
      otherDirs.forEach(function (oDir) {
        console.log('rmdir %s', oDir);
      });
    }
  });

program.parse(process.argv);
```

The variadic argument is passed to the action handler as an array.

### Action handler (sub)commands

You can add options to a command that uses an action handler.
The action handler gets passed a parameter for each argument you declared, and one additional argument which is the
command object itself. This command argument has the values for the command-specific options added as properties.

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .command('rm <dir>')
  .option('-r, --recursive', 'Remove recursively')
  .action(function (dir, cmdObj) {
    console.log('remove ' + dir + (cmdObj.recursive ? ' recursively' : ''))
  })

program.parse(process.argv)
```

You may supply an `async` action handler, in which case you call `.parseAsync` rather than `.parse`.

```js
async function run() { /* code goes here */ }

async function main() {
  program
    .command('run')
    .action(run);
  await program.parseAsync(process.argv);
}
```

A command's options on the command line are validated when the command is used. Any unknown options will be reported as an error.

### Stand-alone executable (sub)commands

When `.command()` is invoked with a description argument, this tells Commander that you're going to use stand-alone executables for subcommands.
Commander will search the executables in the directory of the entry script (like `./examples/pm`) with the name `program-subcommand`, like `pm-install`, `pm-search`.
You can specify a custom name with the `executableFile` configuration option.

You handle the options for an executable (sub)command in the executable, and don't declare them at the top-level.

```js
// file: ./examples/pm
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .command('install [name]', 'install one or more packages')
  .command('search [query]', 'search with optional query')
  .command('update', 'update installed packages', {executableFile: 'myUpdateSubCommand'})
  .command('list', 'list packages installed', {isDefault: true})
  .parse(process.argv);
```

If the program is designed to be installed globally, make sure the executables have proper modes, like `755`.

## Automated help

The help information is auto-generated based on the information commander already knows about your program. The default
help option is `-h,--help`. ([example](./examples/pizza))

```bash
$ node ./examples/pizza --help
Usage: pizza [options]

An application for pizzas ordering

Options:
  -V, --version        output the version number
  -p, --peppers        Add peppers
  -c, --cheese <type>  Add the specified type of cheese (default: "marble")
  -C, --no-cheese      You do not want any cheese
  -h, --help           display help for command
```

A `help` command is added by default if your command has subcommands. It can be used alone, or with a subcommand name to show
further help for the subcommand. These are effectively the same if the `shell` program has implicit help:

```bash
shell help
shell --help

shell help spawn
shell spawn --help
```

### Custom help

You can display extra information by listening for "--help". ([example](./examples/custom-help))

```js
program
  .option('-f, --foo', 'enable some foo');

// must be before .parse()
program.on('--help', () => {
  console.log('');
  console.log('Example call:');
  console.log('  $ custom-help --help');
});
```

Yields the following help output:

```Text
Usage: custom-help [options]

Options:
  -f, --foo   enable some foo
  -h, --help  display help for command

Example call:
  $ custom-help --help
```

### .usage and .name

These allow you to customise the usage description in the first line of the help. The name is otherwise
deduced from the (full) program arguments. Given:

```js
program
  .name("my-command")
  .usage("[global options] command")
```

The help will start with:

```Text
Usage: my-command [global options] command
```

### .help(cb)

Output help information and exit immediately. Optional callback cb allows post-processing of help text before it is displayed.

### .outputHelp(cb)

Output help information without exiting.
Optional callback cb allows post-processing of help text before it is displayed.

### .helpInformation()

Get the command help information as a string for processing or displaying yourself. (The text does not include the custom help
from `--help` listeners.)

### .helpOption(flags, description)

Override the default help flags and description.

```js
program
  .helpOption('-e, --HELP', 'read more information');
```

### .addHelpCommand()

You can explicitly turn on or off the implicit help command with `.addHelpCommand()` and `.addHelpCommand(false)`.

You can both turn on and customise the help command by supplying the name and description:

```js
program.addHelpCommand('assist [command]', 'show assistance');
```

## Custom event listeners

You can execute custom actions by listening to command and option events.

```js
program.on('option:verbose', function () {
  process.env.VERBOSE = this.verbose;
});

program.on('command:*', function (operands) {
  console.error(`error: unknown command '${operands[0]}'`);
  const availableCommands = program.commands.map(cmd => cmd.name());
  mySuggestBestMatch(operands[0], availableCommands);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

## Bits and pieces

### .parse() and .parseAsync()

The first argument to `.parse` is the array of strings to parse. You may omit the parameter to implicitly use `process.argv`.

If the arguments follow different conventions than node you can pass a `from` option in the second parameter:

- 'node': default, `argv[0]` is the application and `argv[1]` is the script being run, with user parameters after that
- 'electron': `argv[1]` varies depending on whether the electron application is packaged
- 'user': all of the arguments from the user

For example:

```js
program.parse(process.argv); // Explicit, node conventions
program.parse(); // Implicit, and auto-detect electron
program.parse(['-f', 'filename'], { from: 'user' });
```

### Avoiding option name clashes

The original and default behaviour is that the option values are stored
as properties on the program, and the action handler is passed a
command object with the options values stored as properties.
This is very convenient to code, but the downside is possible clashes with
existing properties of Command.

There are two new routines to change the behaviour, and the default behaviour may change in the future:

- `storeOptionsAsProperties`: whether to store option values as properties on command object, or store separately (specify false) and access using `.opts()`
- `passCommandToAction`: whether to pass command to action handler,
or just the options (specify false)

([example](./examples/storeOptionsAsProperties-action.js))

```js
program
  .storeOptionsAsProperties(false)
  .passCommandToAction(false);

program
  .name('my-program-name')
  .option('-n,--name <name>');

program
  .command('show')
  .option('-a,--action <action>')
  .action((options) => {
    console.log(options.action);
  });

program.parse(process.argv);

const programOptions = program.opts();
console.log(programOptions.name);
```

### TypeScript

The Commander package includes its TypeScript Definition file.

If you use `ts-node` and  stand-alone executable subcommands written as `.ts` files, you need to call your program through node to get the subcommands called correctly. e.g.

```bash
node -r ts-node/register pm.ts
```

### createCommand()

This factory function creates a new command. It is exported and may be used instead of using `new`, like:

```js
const { createCommand } = require('commander');
const program = createCommand();
```

`createCommand` is also a method of the Command object, and creates a new command rather than a subcommand. This gets used internally
when creating subcommands using `.command()`, and you may override it to
customise the new subcommand (examples using [subclass](./examples/custom-command-class.js) and [function](./examples/custom-command-function.js)).

### Node options such as `--harmony`

You can enable `--harmony` option in two ways:

- Use `#! /usr/bin/env node --harmony` in the subcommands scripts. (Note Windows does not support this pattern.)
- Use the `--harmony` option when call the command, like `node --harmony examples/pm publish`. The `--harmony` option will be preserved when spawning subcommand process.

### Debugging stand-alone executable subcommands

An executable subcommand is launched as a separate child process.

If you are using the node inspector for [debugging](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/) executable subcommands using `node --inspect` et al,
the inspector port is incremented by 1 for the spawned subcommand.

If you are using VSCode to debug executable subcommands you need to set the `"autoAttachChildProcesses": true` flag in your launch.json configuration.

### Override exit handling

By default Commander calls `process.exit` when it detects errors, or after displaying the help or version. You can override
this behaviour and optionally supply a callback. The default override throws a `CommanderError`.

The override callback is passed a `CommanderError` with properties `exitCode` number, `code` string, and `message`. The default override behaviour is to throw the error, except for async handling of executable subcommand completion which carries on. The normal display of error messages or version or help
is not affected by the override which is called after the display.

``` js
program.exitOverride();

try {
  program.parse(process.argv);
} catch (err) {
  // custom processing...
}
```

## Examples

```js
const { program } = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .option('-C, --chdir <path>', 'change the working directory')
  .option('-c, --config <path>', 'set config path. defaults to ./deploy.conf')
  .option('-T, --no-tests', 'ignore test hook');

program
  .command('setup [env]')
  .description('run setup commands for all envs')
  .option("-s, --setup_mode [mode]", "Which setup mode to use")
  .action(function(env, options){
    const mode = options.setup_mode || "normal";
    env = env || 'all';
    console.log('setup for %s env(s) with %s mode', env, mode);
  });

program
  .command('exec <cmd>')
  .alias('ex')
  .description('execute the given remote cmd')
  .option("-e, --exec_mode <mode>", "Which exec mode to use")
  .action(function(cmd, options){
    console.log('exec "%s" using %s mode', cmd, options.exec_mode);
  }).on('--help', function() {
    console.log('');
    console.log('Examples:');
    console.log('');
    console.log('  $ deploy exec sequential');
    console.log('  $ deploy exec async');
  });

program.parse(process.argv);
```

# defer-to-connect

> The safe way to handle the `connect` socket event

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/szmarczak/defer-to-connect/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/szmarczak/defer-to-connect?branch=master)

Once you receive the socket, it may be already connected (or disconnected).<br>
To avoid checking that, use `defer-to-connect`. It'll do that for you.

## Usage

```js
const deferToConnect = require('defer-to-connect');

deferToConnect(socket, () => {
    console.log('Connected!');
});
```

## API

### deferToConnect(socket, connectListener)

Calls `connectListener()` when connected.

### deferToConnect(socket, listeners)

#### listeners

An object representing `connect`, `secureConnect` and `close` properties.

Calls `connect()` when the socket is connected.<br>
Calls `secureConnect()` when the socket is securely connected.<br>
Calls `close()` when the socket is destroyed.

Like [duplexer2](https://github.com/deoxxa/duplexer2) but using Streams3 without readable-stream dependency

```javascript
var stream = require("stream");

var duplexer3 = require("duplexer3");

var writable = new stream.Writable({objectMode: true}),
    readable = new stream.Readable({objectMode: true});

writable._write = function _write(input, encoding, done) {
  if (readable.push(input)) {
    return done();
  } else {
    readable.once("drain", done);
  }
};

readable._read = function _read(n) {
  // no-op
};

// simulate the readable thing closing after a bit
writable.once("finish", function() {
  setTimeout(function() {
    readable.push(null);
  }, 500);
});

var duplex = duplexer3(writable, readable);

duplex.on("data", function(e) {
  console.log("got data", JSON.stringify(e));
});

duplex.on("finish", function() {
  console.log("got finish event");
});

duplex.on("end", function() {
  console.log("got end event");
});

duplex.write("oh, hi there", function() {
  console.log("finished writing");
});

duplex.end(function() {
  console.log("finished ending");
});
```

```
got data "oh, hi there"
finished writing
got finish event
finished ending
got end event
```

## Overview

This is a reimplementation of [duplexer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/duplexer) using the
Streams3 API which is standard in Node as of v4. Everything largely
works the same.



## Installation

[Available via `npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

```
$ npm i duplexer3
```

## API

### duplexer3

Creates a new `DuplexWrapper` object, which is the actual class that implements
most of the fun stuff. All that fun stuff is hidden. DON'T LOOK.

```javascript
duplexer3([options], writable, readable)
```

```javascript
const duplex = duplexer3(new stream.Writable(), new stream.Readable());
```

Arguments

* __options__ - an object specifying the regular `stream.Duplex` options, as
  well as the properties described below.
* __writable__ - a writable stream
* __readable__ - a readable stream

Options

* __bubbleErrors__ - a boolean value that specifies whether to bubble errors
  from the underlying readable/writable streams. Default is `true`.

### [Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/emoji-regex/README.md](Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/emoji-regex/README.md)
# emoji-regex [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/mathiasbynens/emoji-regex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mathiasbynens/emoji-regex)

_emoji-regex_ offers a regular expression to match all emoji symbols (including textual representations of emoji) as per the Unicode Standard.

This repository contains a script that generates this regular expression based on [the data from Unicode v12](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/unicode-12.0.0). Because of this, the regular expression can easily be updated whenever new emoji are added to the Unicode standard.

## Installation

Via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install emoji-regex
```

In [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/):

```js
const emojiRegex = require('emoji-regex');
// Note: because the regular expression has the global flag set, this module
// exports a function that returns the regex rather than exporting the regular
// expression itself, to make it impossible to (accidentally) mutate the
// original regular expression.

const text = `
\u{231A}: ⌚ default emoji presentation character (Emoji_Presentation)
\u{2194}\u{FE0F}: ↔️ default text presentation character rendered as emoji
\u{1F469}: 👩 emoji modifier base (Emoji_Modifier_Base)
\u{1F469}\u{1F3FF}: 👩🏿 emoji modifier base followed by a modifier
`;

const regex = emojiRegex();
let match;
while (match = regex.exec(text)) {
  const emoji = match[0];
  console.log(`Matched sequence ${ emoji } — code points: ${ [...emoji].length }`);
}
```

Console output:

```
Matched sequence ⌚ — code points: 1
Matched sequence ⌚ — code points: 1
Matched sequence ↔️ — code points: 2
Matched sequence ↔️ — code points: 2
Matched sequence 👩 — code points: 1
Matched sequence 👩 — code points: 1
Matched sequence 👩🏿 — code points: 2
Matched sequence 👩🏿 — code points: 2
```

To match emoji in their textual representation as well (i.e. emoji that are not `Emoji_Presentation` symbols and that aren’t forced to render as emoji by a variation selector), `require` the other regex:

```js
const emojiRegex = require('emoji-regex/text.js');
```

Additionally, in environments which support ES2015 Unicode escapes, you may `require` ES2015-style versions of the regexes:

```js
const emojiRegex = require('emoji-regex/es2015/index.js');
const emojiRegexText = require('emoji-regex/es2015/text.js');
```

# end-of-stream

A node module that calls a callback when a readable/writable/duplex stream has completed or failed.

	npm install end-of-stream

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/mafintosh/end-of-stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mafintosh/end-of-stream)

## Usage

Simply pass a stream and a callback to the `eos`.
Both legacy streams, streams2 and stream3 are supported.

``` js
var eos = require('end-of-stream');

eos(readableStream, function(err) {
  // this will be set to the stream instance
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has ended', this === readableStream);
});

eos(writableStream, function(err) {
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has finished', this === writableStream);
});

eos(duplexStream, function(err) {
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has ended and finished', this === duplexStream);
});

eos(duplexStream, {readable:false}, function(err) {
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has finished but might still be readable');
});

eos(duplexStream, {writable:false}, function(err) {
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has ended but might still be writable');
});

eos(readableStream, {error:false}, function(err) {
	// do not treat emit('error', err) as a end-of-stream
});
```

# fast-glob

> It's a very fast and efficient [glob][glob_definition] library for [Node.js][node_js].

This package provides methods for traversing the file system and returning pathnames that matched a defined set of a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix Bash shell with some simplifications, meanwhile results are returned in **arbitrary order**. Quick, simple, effective.

## Old and modern mode

This package works in two modes, depending on the environment in which it is used.

* **Old mode**. Node.js below 10.10 or when the [`stats`](#stats) option is *enabled*.
* **Modern mode**. Node.js 10.10+ and the [`stats`](#stats) option is *disabled*.

The modern mode is faster. Learn more about the [internal mechanism][nodelib_fs_scandir_old_and_modern_modern].

## Pattern syntax

> :warning: Always use forward-slashes in glob expressions (patterns and [`ignore`](#ignore) option). Use backslashes for escaping characters.

There is more than one form of syntax: basic and advanced. Below is a brief overview of the supported features. Also pay attention to our [FAQ](#faq).

> :book: This package uses a [`micromatch`][micromatch] as a library for pattern matching.

### Basic syntax

* An asterisk (`*`) — matches everything except slashes (path separators), hidden files (names starting with `.`).
* A double star or globstar (`**`) — matches zero or more directories.
* Question mark (`?`) – matches any single character except slashes (path separators).
* Sequence (`[seq]`) — matches any character in sequence.

> :book: A few additional words about the [basic matching behavior][picomatch_matching_behavior].

Some examples:

* `src/**/*.js` — matches all files in the `src` directory (any level of nesting) that have the `.js` extension.
* `src/*.??` — matches all files in the `src` directory (only first level of nesting) that have a two-character extension.
* `file-[01].js` — matches files: `file-0.js`, `file-1.js`.

### Advanced syntax

* [Escapes characters][micromatch_backslashes] (`\\`) — matching special characters (`$^*+?()[]`) as literals.
* [POSIX character classes][picomatch_posix_brackets] (`[[:digit:]]`).
* [Extended globs][micromatch_extglobs] (`?(pattern-list)`).
* [Bash style brace expansions][micromatch_braces] (`{}`).
* [Regexp character classes][micromatch_regex_character_classes] (`[1-5]`).
* [Regex groups][regular_expressions_brackets] (`(a|b)`).

> :book: A few additional words about the [advanced matching behavior][micromatch_extended_globbing].

Some examples:

* `src/**/*.{css,scss}` — matches all files in the `src` directory (any level of nesting) that have the `.css` or `.scss` extension.
* `file-[[:digit:]].js` — matches files: `file-0.js`, `file-1.js`, …, `file-9.js`.
* `file-{1..3}.js` — matches files: `file-1.js`, `file-2.js`, `file-3.js`.
* `file-(1|2)` — matches files: `file-1.js`, `file-2.js`.

## Installation

```console
npm install fast-glob
```

## API

### Asynchronous

```js
fg(patterns, [options])
```

Returns a `Promise` with an array of matching entries.

```js
const fg = require('fast-glob');

const entries = await fg(['.editorconfig', '**/index.js'], { dot: true });

// ['.editorconfig', 'services/index.js']
```

### Synchronous

```js
fg.sync(patterns, [options])
```

Returns an array of matching entries.

```js
const fg = require('fast-glob');

const entries = fg.sync(['.editorconfig', '**/index.js'], { dot: true });

// ['.editorconfig', 'services/index.js']
```

### Stream

```js
fg.stream(patterns, [options])
```

Returns a [`ReadableStream`][node_js_stream_readable_streams] when the `data` event will be emitted with matching entry.

```js
const fg = require('fast-glob');

const stream = fg.stream(['.editorconfig', '**/index.js'], { dot: true });

for await (const entry of stream) {
	// .editorconfig
	// services/index.js
}
```

#### patterns

* Required: `true`
* Type: `string | string[]`

Any correct pattern(s).

> :1234: [Pattern syntax](#pattern-syntax)
>
> :warning: This package does not respect the order of patterns. First, all the negative patterns are applied, and only then the positive patterns. If you want to get a certain order of records, use sorting or split calls.

#### [options]

* Required: `false`
* Type: [`Options`](#options-3)

See [Options](#options-3) section.

### Helpers

#### `generateTasks(patterns, [options])`

Returns the internal representation of patterns ([`Task`](./src/managers/tasks.ts) is a combining patterns by base directory).

```js
fg.generateTasks('*');

[{
    base: '.', // Parent directory for all patterns inside this task
    dynamic: true, // Dynamic or static patterns are in this task
    patterns: ['*'],
    positive: ['*'],
    negative: []
}]
```

##### patterns

* Required: `true`
* Type: `string | string[]`

Any correct pattern(s).

##### [options]

* Required: `false`
* Type: [`Options`](#options-3)

See [Options](#options-3) section.

#### `isDynamicPattern(pattern, [options])`

Returns `true` if the passed pattern is a dynamic pattern.

> :1234: [What is a static or dynamic pattern?](#what-is-a-static-or-dynamic-pattern)

```js
fg.isDynamicPattern('*'); // true
fg.isDynamicPattern('abc'); // false
```

##### pattern

* Required: `true`
* Type: `string`

Any correct pattern.

##### [options]

* Required: `false`
* Type: [`Options`](#options-3)

See [Options](#options-3) section.

#### `escapePath(pattern)`

Returns a path with escaped special characters (`*?|(){}[]`, `!` at the beginning of line, `@+!` before the opening parenthesis).

```js
fg.escapePath('!abc'); // \\!abc
fg.escapePath('C:/Program Files (x86)'); // C:/Program Files \\(x86\\)
```

##### pattern

* Required: `true`
* Type: `string`

Any string, for example, a path to a file.

## Options

### Common options

#### concurrency

* Type: `number`
* Default: `os.cpus().length`

Specifies the maximum number of concurrent requests from a reader to read directories.

> :book: The higher the number, the higher the performance and load on the file system. If you want to read in quiet mode, set the value to a comfortable number or `1`.

#### cwd

* Type: `string`
* Default: `process.cwd()`

The current working directory in which to search.

#### deep

* Type: `number`
* Default: `Infinity`

Specifies the maximum depth of a read directory relative to the start directory.

For example, you have the following tree:

```js
dir/
└── one/            // 1
    └── two/        // 2
        └── file.js // 3
```

```js
// With base directory
fg.sync('dir/**', { onlyFiles: false, deep: 1 }); // ['dir/one']
fg.sync('dir/**', { onlyFiles: false, deep: 2 }); // ['dir/one', 'dir/one/two']

// With cwd option
fg.sync('**', { onlyFiles: false, cwd: 'dir', deep: 1 }); // ['one']
fg.sync('**', { onlyFiles: false, cwd: 'dir', deep: 2 }); // ['one', 'one/two']
```

> :book: If you specify a pattern with some base directory, this directory will not participate in the calculation of the depth of the found directories. Think of it as a [`cwd`](#cwd) option.

#### followSymbolicLinks

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Indicates whether to traverse descendants of symbolic link directories.

> :book: If the [`stats`](#stats) option is specified, the information about the symbolic link (`fs.lstat`) will be replaced with information about the entry (`fs.stat`) behind it.

#### fs

* Type: `FileSystemAdapter`
* Default: `fs.*`

Custom implementation of methods for working with the file system.

```ts
export interface FileSystemAdapter {
    lstat?: typeof fs.lstat;
    stat?: typeof fs.stat;
    lstatSync?: typeof fs.lstatSync;
    statSync?: typeof fs.statSync;
    readdir?: typeof fs.readdir;
    readdirSync?: typeof fs.readdirSync;
}
```

#### ignore

* Type: `string[]`
* Default: `[]`

An array of glob patterns to exclude matches. This is an alternative way to use negative patterns.

```js
dir/
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
```

```js
fg.sync(['*.json', '!package-lock.json']);            // ['package.json']
fg.sync('*.json', { ignore: ['package-lock.json'] }); // ['package.json']
```

#### suppressErrors

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

By default this package suppress only `ENOENT` errors. Set to `true` to suppress any error.

> :book: Can be useful when the directory has entries with a special level of access.

#### throwErrorOnBrokenSymbolicLink

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Throw an error when symbolic link is broken if `true` or safely return `lstat` call if `false`.

> :book: This option has no effect on errors when reading the symbolic link directory.

### Output control

#### absolute

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Return the absolute path for entries.

```js
fg.sync('*.js', { absolute: false }); // ['index.js']
fg.sync('*.js', { absolute: true });  // ['/home/user/index.js']
```

> :book: This option is required if you want to use negative patterns with absolute path, for example, `!${__dirname}/*.js`.

#### markDirectories

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Mark the directory path with the final slash.

```js
fg.sync('*', { onlyFiles: false, markDirectories: false }); // ['index.js', 'controllers']
fg.sync('*', { onlyFiles: false, markDirectories: true });  // ['index.js', 'controllers/']
```

#### objectMode

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Returns objects (instead of strings) describing entries.

```js
fg.sync('*', { objectMode: false }); // ['src/index.js']
fg.sync('*', { objectMode: true });  // [{ name: 'index.js', path: 'src/index.js', dirent: <fs.Dirent> }]
```

The object has the following fields:

* name (`string`) — the last part of the path (basename)
* path (`string`) — full path relative to the pattern base directory
* dirent ([`fs.Dirent`][node_js_fs_class_fs_dirent]) — instance of `fs.Direct`

> :book: An object is an internal representation of entry, so getting it does not affect performance.

#### onlyDirectories

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Return only directories.

```js
fg.sync('*', { onlyDirectories: false }); // ['index.js', 'src']
fg.sync('*', { onlyDirectories: true });  // ['src']
```

> :book: If `true`, the [`onlyFiles`](#onlyfiles) option is automatically `false`.

#### onlyFiles

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Return only files.

```js
fg.sync('*', { onlyFiles: false }); // ['index.js', 'src']
fg.sync('*', { onlyFiles: true });  // ['index.js']
```

#### stats

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Enables an [object mode](#objectmode) with an additional field:

* stats ([`fs.Stats`][node_js_fs_class_fs_stats]) — instance of `fs.Stats`

```js
fg.sync('*', { stats: false }); // ['src/index.js']
fg.sync('*', { stats: true });  // [{ name: 'index.js', path: 'src/index.js', dirent: <fs.Dirent>, stats: <fs.Stats> }]
```

> :book: Returns `fs.stat` instead of `fs.lstat` for symbolic links when the [`followSymbolicLinks`](#followsymboliclinks) option is specified.
>
> :warning: Unlike [object mode](#objectmode) this mode requires additional calls to the file system. On average, this mode is slower at least twice. See [old and modern mode](#old-and-modern-mode) for more details.

#### unique

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Ensures that the returned entries are unique.

```js
fg.sync(['*.json', 'package.json'], { unique: false }); // ['package.json', 'package.json']
fg.sync(['*.json', 'package.json'], { unique: true });  // ['package.json']
```

If `true` and similar entries are found, the result is the first found.

### Matching control

#### braceExpansion

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Enables Bash-like brace expansion.

> :1234: [Syntax description][bash_hackers_syntax_expansion_brace] or more [detailed description][micromatch_braces].

```js
dir/
├── abd
├── acd
└── a{b,c}d
```

```js
fg.sync('a{b,c}d', { braceExpansion: false }); // ['a{b,c}d']
fg.sync('a{b,c}d', { braceExpansion: true });  // ['abd', 'acd']
```

#### caseSensitiveMatch

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Enables a [case-sensitive][wikipedia_case_sensitivity] mode for matching files.

```js
dir/
├── file.txt
└── File.txt
```

```js
fg.sync('file.txt', { caseSensitiveMatch: false }); // ['file.txt', 'File.txt']
fg.sync('file.txt', { caseSensitiveMatch: true });  // ['file.txt']
```

#### dot

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

Allow patterns to match entries that begin with a period (`.`).

> :book: Note that an explicit dot in a portion of the pattern will always match dot files.

```js
dir/
├── .editorconfig
└── package.json
```

```js
fg.sync('*', { dot: false }); // ['package.json']
fg.sync('*', { dot: true });  // ['.editorconfig', 'package.json']
```

#### extglob

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Enables Bash-like `extglob` functionality.

> :1234: [Syntax description][micromatch_extglobs].

```js
dir/
├── README.md
└── package.json
```

```js
fg.sync('*.+(json|md)', { extglob: false }); // []
fg.sync('*.+(json|md)', { extglob: true });  // ['README.md', 'package.json']
```

#### globstar

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

Enables recursively repeats a pattern containing `**`. If `false`, `**` behaves exactly like `*`.

```js
dir/
└── a
    └── b
```

```js
fg.sync('**', { onlyFiles: false, globstar: false }); // ['a']
fg.sync('**', { onlyFiles: false, globstar: true });  // ['a', 'a/b']
```

#### baseNameMatch

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

If set to `true`, then patterns without slashes will be matched against the basename of the path if it contains slashes.

```js
dir/
└── one/
    └── file.md
```

```js
fg.sync('*.md', { baseNameMatch: false }); // []
fg.sync('*.md', { baseNameMatch: true });  // ['one/file.md']
```

## FAQ

## What is a static or dynamic pattern?

All patterns can be divided into two types:

* **static**. A pattern is considered static if it can be used to get an entry on the file system without using matching mechanisms. For example, the `file.js` pattern is a static pattern because we can just verify that it exists on the file system.
* **dynamic**. A pattern is considered dynamic if it cannot be used directly to find occurrences without using a matching mechanisms. For example, the `*` pattern is a dynamic pattern because we cannot use this pattern directly.

A pattern is considered dynamic if it contains the following characters (`…` — any characters or their absence) or options:

* The [`caseSensitiveMatch`](#casesensitivematch) option is disabled
* `\\` (the escape character)
* `*`, `?`, `!` (at the beginning of line)
* `[…]`
* `(…|…)`
* `@(…)`, `!(…)`, `*(…)`, `?(…)`, `+(…)` (respects the [`extglob`](#extglob) option)
* `{…,…}`, `{…..…}` (respects the [`braceExpansion`](#braceexpansion) option)

## How to write patterns on Windows?

Always use forward-slashes in glob expressions (patterns and [`ignore`](#ignore) option). Use backslashes for escaping characters. With the [`cwd`](#cwd) option use a convenient format.

**Bad**

```ts
[
	'directory\\*',
	path.join(process.cwd(), '**')
]
```

**Good**

```ts
[
	'directory/*',
	path.join(process.cwd(), '**').replace(/\\/g, '/')
]
```

> :book: Use the [`normalize-path`][npm_normalize_path] or the [`unixify`][npm_unixify] package to convert Windows-style path to a Unix-style path.

Read more about [matching with backslashes][micromatch_backslashes].

## Why are parentheses match wrong?

```js
dir/
└── (special-*file).txt
```

```js
fg.sync(['(special-*file).txt']) // []
```

Refers to Bash. You need to escape special characters:

```js
fg.sync(['\\(special-*file\\).txt']) // ['(special-*file).txt']
```

Read more about [matching special characters as literals][picomatch_matching_special_characters_as_literals].

## How to exclude directory from reading?

You can use a negative pattern like this: `!**/node_modules` or `!**/node_modules/**`. Also you can use [`ignore`](#ignore) option. Just look at the example below.

```js
first/
├── file.md
└── second/
    └── file.txt
```

If you don't want to read the `second` directory, you must write the following pattern: `!**/second` or `!**/second/**`.

```js
fg.sync(['**/*.md', '!**/second']);                 // ['first/file.md']
fg.sync(['**/*.md'], { ignore: ['**/second/**'] }); // ['first/file.md']
```

> :warning: When you write `!**/second/**/*` it means that the directory will be **read**, but all the entries will not be included in the results.

You have to understand that if you write the pattern to exclude directories, then the directory will not be read under any circumstances.

## How to use UNC path?

You cannot use [Uniform Naming Convention (UNC)][unc_path] paths as patterns (due to syntax), but you can use them as [`cwd`](#cwd) directory.

```ts
fg.sync('*', { cwd: '\\\\?\\C:\\Python27' /* or //?/C:/Python27 */ });
fg.sync('Python27/*', { cwd: '\\\\?\\C:\\' /* or //?/C:/ */ });
```

## Compatible with `node-glob`?

| node-glob    | fast-glob |
| :----------: | :-------: |
| `cwd`        | [`cwd`](#cwd) |
| `root`       | – |
| `dot`        | [`dot`](#dot) |

> Fill in a range of numbers or letters, optionally passing an increment or `step` to use, or create a regex-compatible range with `options.toRegex`

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save fill-range
```

## Usage

Expands numbers and letters, optionally using a `step` as the last argument. _(Numbers may be defined as JavaScript numbers or strings)_.

```js
const fill = require('fill-range');
// fill(from, to[, step, options]);

console.log(fill('1', '10')); //=> ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10']
console.log(fill('1', '10', { toRegex: true })); //=> [1-9]|10
```

**Params**

* `from`: **{String|Number}** the number or letter to start with
* `to`: **{String|Number}** the number or letter to end with
* `step`: **{String|Number|Object|Function}** Optionally pass a [step](#optionsstep) to use.
* `options`: **{Object|Function}**: See all available [options](#options)

## Examples

By default, an array of values is returned.

**Alphabetical ranges**

```js
console.log(fill('a', 'e')); //=> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
console.log(fill('A', 'E')); //=> [ 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E' ]
```

**Numerical ranges**

Numbers can be defined as actual numbers or strings.

```js
console.log(fill(1, 5));     //=> [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
console.log(fill('1', '5')); //=> [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
```

**Negative ranges**

Numbers can be defined as actual numbers or strings.

```js
console.log(fill('-5', '-1')); //=> [ '-5', '-4', '-3', '-2', '-1' ]
console.log(fill('-5', '5')); //=> [ '-5', '-4', '-3', '-2', '-1', '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5' ]
```

**Steps (increments)**

```js
// numerical ranges with increments
console.log(fill('0', '25', 4)); //=> [ '0', '4', '8', '12', '16', '20', '24' ]
console.log(fill('0', '25', 5)); //=> [ '0', '5', '10', '15', '20', '25' ]
console.log(fill('0', '25', 6)); //=> [ '0', '6', '12', '18', '24' ]

// alphabetical ranges with increments
console.log(fill('a', 'z', 4)); //=> [ 'a', 'e', 'i', 'm', 'q', 'u', 'y' ]
console.log(fill('a', 'z', 5)); //=> [ 'a', 'f', 'k', 'p', 'u', 'z' ]
console.log(fill('a', 'z', 6)); //=> [ 'a', 'g', 'm', 's', 'y' ]
```

## Options

### options.step

**Type**: `number` (formatted as a string or number)

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: The increment to use for the range. Can be used with letters or numbers.

**Example(s)**

```js
// numbers
console.log(fill('1', '10', 2)); //=> [ '1', '3', '5', '7', '9' ]
console.log(fill('1', '10', 3)); //=> [ '1', '4', '7', '10' ]
console.log(fill('1', '10', 4)); //=> [ '1', '5', '9' ]

// letters
console.log(fill('a', 'z', 5)); //=> [ 'a', 'f', 'k', 'p', 'u', 'z' ]
console.log(fill('a', 'z', 7)); //=> [ 'a', 'h', 'o', 'v' ]
console.log(fill('a', 'z', 9)); //=> [ 'a', 'j', 's' ]
```

### options.strictRanges

**Type**: `boolean`

**Default**: `false`

**Description**: By default, `null` is returned when an invalid range is passed. Enable this option to throw a `RangeError` on invalid ranges.

**Example(s)**

The following are all invalid:

```js
fill('1.1', '2');   // decimals not supported in ranges
fill('a', '2');     // incompatible range values
fill(1, 10, 'foo'); // invalid "step" argument
```

### options.stringify

**Type**: `boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: Cast all returned values to strings. By default, integers are returned as numbers.

**Example(s)**

```js
console.log(fill(1, 5));                    //=> [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
console.log(fill(1, 5, { stringify: true })); //=> [ '1', '2', '3', '4', '5' ]
```

### options.toRegex

**Type**: `boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: Create a regex-compatible source string, instead of expanding values to an array.

**Example(s)**

```js
// alphabetical range
console.log(fill('a', 'e', { toRegex: true })); //=> '[a-e]'
// alphabetical with step
console.log(fill('a', 'z', 3, { toRegex: true })); //=> 'a|d|g|j|m|p|s|v|y'
// numerical range
console.log(fill('1', '100', { toRegex: true })); //=> '[1-9]|[1-9][0-9]|100'
// numerical range with zero padding
console.log(fill('000001', '100000', { toRegex: true }));
//=> '0{5}[1-9]|0{4}[1-9][0-9]|0{3}[1-9][0-9]{2}|0{2}[1-9][0-9]{3}|0[1-9][0-9]{4}|100000'
```

### options.transform

**Type**: `function`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Description**: Customize each value in the returned array (or [string](#optionstoRegex)). _(you can also pass this function as the last argument to `fill()`)_.

**Example(s)**

```js
// add zero padding
console.log(fill(1, 5, value => String(value).padStart(4, '0')));
//=> ['0001', '0002', '0003', '0004', '0005']
```

# find-up [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/find-up.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/find-up)

> Find a file or directory by walking up parent directories


## Install

```
$ npm install find-up
```


## Usage

```
/
└── Users
    └── sindresorhus
        ├── unicorn.png
        └── foo
            └── bar
                ├── baz
                └── example.js
```

`example.js`

```js
const path = require('path');
const findUp = require('find-up');

(async () => {
	console.log(await findUp('unicorn.png'));
	//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/unicorn.png'

	console.log(await findUp(['rainbow.png', 'unicorn.png']));
	//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/unicorn.png'

	console.log(await findUp(async directory => {
		const hasUnicorns = await findUp.exists(path.join(directory, 'unicorn.png'));
		return hasUnicorns && directory;
	}, {type: 'directory'}));
	//=> '/Users/sindresorhus'
})();
```


## API

### findUp(name, options?)
### findUp(matcher, options?)

Returns a `Promise` for either the path or `undefined` if it couldn't be found.

### findUp([...name], options?)

Returns a `Promise` for either the first path found (by respecting the order of the array) or `undefined` if none could be found.

### findUp.sync(name, options?)
### findUp.sync(matcher, options?)

Returns a path or `undefined` if it couldn't be found.

### findUp.sync([...name], options?)

Returns the first path found (by respecting the order of the array) or `undefined` if none could be found.

#### name

Type: `string`

Name of the file or directory to find.

#### matcher

Type: `Function`

A function that will be called with each directory until it returns a `string` with the path, which stops the search, or the root directory has been reached and nothing was found. Useful if you want to match files with certain patterns, set of permissions, or other advanced use-cases.

When using async mode, the `matcher` may optionally be an async or promise-returning function that returns the path.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### cwd

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `process.cwd()`

Directory to start from.

##### type

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `'file'`<br>
Values: `'file'` `'directory'`

The type of paths that can match.

##### allowSymlinks

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

Allow symbolic links to match if they point to the chosen path type.

### findUp.exists(path)

Returns a `Promise<boolean>` of whether the path exists.

### findUp.sync.exists(path)

Returns a `boolean` of whether the path exists.

#### path

Type: `string`

Path to a file or directory.

### findUp.stop

A [`Symbol`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) that can be returned by a `matcher` function to stop the search and cause `findUp` to immediately return `undefined`. Useful as a performance optimization in case the current working directory is deeply nested in the filesystem.

```js
const path = require('path');
const findUp = require('find-up');

(async () => {
	await findUp(directory => {
		return path.basename(directory) === 'work' ? findUp.stop : 'logo.png';
	});
})();
```

5.0.0 / 2017-12-11
------------------

Significant refactor of `copy()` & `copySync()`, including breaking changes. No changes to other functions in this release.

Huge thanks to **[@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou)** for doing most of the work on this release.

- The `filter` option can no longer be a RegExp (must be a function). This was deprecated since fs-extra v1.0.0. [#512](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/512)
- `copy()`'s `filter` option can now be a function that returns a Promise. [#518](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/518)
- `copy()` & `copySync()` now use `fs.copyFile()`/`fs.copyFileSync()` in environments that support it (currently Node 8.5.0+). Older Node versions still get the old implementation. [#505](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/505)
- Don't allow copying a directory into itself. [#83](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/83)
- Handle copying between identical files. [#198](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/198)
- Error out when copying an empty folder to a path that already exists. [#464](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/464)
- Don't create `dest`'s parent if the `filter` function aborts the `copy()` operation. [#517](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/517)
- Fix `writeStream` not being closed if there was an error in `copy()`. [#516](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/516)

4.0.3 / 2017-12-05
------------------

- Fix wrong `chmod` values in `fs.remove()` [#501](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/501)
- Fix `TypeError` on systems that don't have some `fs` operations like `lchown` [#520](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/520)

4.0.2 / 2017-09-12
------------------

- Added `EOL` option to `writeJson*` & `outputJson*` (via upgrade to jsonfile v4)
- Added promise support to [`fs.copyFile()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_copyfile_src_dest_flags_callback) in Node 8.5+
- Added `.js` extension to `main` field in `package.json` for better tooling compatibility. [#485](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/485)

4.0.1 / 2017-07-31
------------------

### Fixed

- Previously, `ensureFile()` & `ensureFileSync()` would do nothing if the path was a directory. Now, they error out for consistency with `ensureDir()`. [#465](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/465), [#466](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/466), [#470](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/470)

4.0.0 / 2017-07-14
------------------

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** The promisified versions of `fs.read()` & `fs.write()` now return objects. See [the docs](docs/fs-read-write.md) for details. [#436](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/436), [#449](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/449)
- `fs.move()` now errors out when destination is a subdirectory of source. [#458](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/458)
- Applied upstream fixes from `rimraf` to `fs.remove()` & `fs.removeSync()`. [#459](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/459)

### Fixed

- Got `fs.outputJSONSync()` working again; it was broken due to refactoring. [#428](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/428)

Also clarified the docs in a few places.

3.0.1 / 2017-05-04
------------------

- Fix bug in `move()` & `moveSync()` when source and destination are the same, and source does not exist. [#415](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/415)

3.0.0 / 2017-04-27
------------------

### Added

- **BREAKING:** Added Promise support. All asynchronous native fs methods and fs-extra methods now return a promise if the callback is not passed. [#403](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/403)
- `pathExists()`, a replacement for the deprecated `fs.exists`. `pathExists` has a normal error-first callback signature. Also added `pathExistsSync`, an alias to `fs.existsSync`, for completeness. [#406](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/406)

### Removed

- **BREAKING:** Removed support for setting the default spaces for `writeJson()`, `writeJsonSync()`, `outputJson()`, & `outputJsonSync()`. This was undocumented. [#402](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402)

### Changed

- Upgraded jsonfile dependency to v3.0.0:
  - **BREAKING:** Changed behavior of `throws` option for `readJsonSync()`; now does not throw filesystem errors when `throws` is `false`.
- **BREAKING:** `writeJson()`, `writeJsonSync()`, `outputJson()`, & `outputJsonSync()` now output minified JSON by default for consistency with `JSON.stringify()`; set the `spaces` option to `2` to override this new behavior. [#402](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402)
- Use `Buffer.allocUnsafe()` instead of `new Buffer()` in environments that support it. [#394](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/394)

### Fixed

- `removeSync()` silently failed on Windows in some cases. Now throws an `EBUSY` error. [#408](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/408)

2.1.2 / 2017-03-16
------------------

### Fixed

- Weird windows bug that resulted in `ensureDir()`'s callback being called twice in some cases. This bug may have also affected `remove()`. See [#392](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/392), [#393](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/393)

2.1.1 / 2017-03-15
------------------

### Fixed

- Reverted [`5597bd`](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/commit/5597bd5b67f7d060f5f5bf26e9635be48330f5d7), this broke compatibility with Node.js versions v4+ but less than `v4.5.0`.
- Remove `Buffer.alloc()` usage in `moveSync()`.

2.1.0 / 2017-03-15
------------------

Thanks to [Mani Maghsoudlou (@manidlou)](https://github.com/manidlou) & [Jan Peer Stöcklmair (@JPeer264)](https://github.com/JPeer264) for their extraordinary help with this release!

### Added
- `moveSync()` See [#309], [#381](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/381). ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))
- `copy()` and `copySync()`'s `filter` option now gets the destination path passed as the second parameter. [#366](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/366) ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))

### Changed
- Use `Buffer.alloc()` instead of deprecated `new Buffer()` in `copySync()`. [#380](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/380) ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))
- Refactored entire codebase to use ES6 features supported by Node.js v4+ [#355](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/355). [(@JPeer264)](https://github.com/JPeer264)
- Refactored docs. ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))

### Fixed

- `move()` shouldn't error out when source and dest are the same. [#377](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/377), [#378](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/378) ([@jdalton](https://github.com/jdalton))

2.0.0 / 2017-01-16
------------------

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Removed support for Node `v0.12`. The Node foundation stopped officially supporting it
on Jan 1st, 2017.
- **BREAKING:** Remove `walk()` and `walkSync()`. `walkSync()` was only part of `fs-extra` for a little
over two months. Use [klaw](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw) instead of `walk()`, in fact, `walk()` was just
an alias to klaw. For `walkSync()` use [klaw-sync](https://github.com/mawni/node-klaw-sync). See: [#338], [#339]

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Renamed `clobber` to `overwrite`. This affects `copy()`, `copySync()`, and `move()`. [#330], [#333]
- Moved docs, to `docs/`. [#340]

### Fixed
- Apply filters to directories in `copySync()` like in `copy()`. [#324]
- A specific condition when disk is under heavy use, `copy()` can fail. [#326]


1.0.0 / 2016-11-01
------------------

After five years of development, we finally have reach the 1.0.0 milestone! Big thanks goes
to [Ryan Zim](https://github.com/RyanZim) for leading the charge on this release!

### Added
- `walkSync()`

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: dropped Node v0.10 support.
- disabled `rimaf` globbing, wasn't used. [#280]
- deprecate `copy()/copySync()` option `filter` if it's a `RegExp`. `filter` should now be a function.
- inline `rimraf`. This is temporary and was done because `rimraf` depended upon the beefy `glob` which `fs-extra` does not use. [#300]

### Fixed
- bug fix proper closing of file handle on `utimesMillis()` [#271]
- proper escaping of files with dollar signs [#291]
- `copySync()` failed if user didn't own file. [#199], [#301]


0.30.0 / 2016-04-28
-------------------
- Brought back Node v0.10 support. I didn't realize there was still demand. Official support will end **2016-10-01**.

0.29.0 / 2016-04-27
-------------------
- **BREAKING**: removed support for Node v0.10. If you still want to use Node v0.10, everything should work except for `ensureLink()/ensureSymlink()`. Node v0.12 is still supported but will be dropped in the near future as well.

0.28.0 / 2016-04-17
-------------------
- **BREAKING**: removed `createOutputStream()`. Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-output-stream. See: [#192][#192]
- `mkdirs()/mkdirsSync()` check for invalid win32 path chars. See: [#209][#209], [#237][#237]
- `mkdirs()/mkdirsSync()` if drive not mounted, error. See: [#93][#93]

0.27.0 / 2016-04-15
-------------------
- add `dereference` option to `copySync()`. [#235][#235]

0.26.7 / 2016-03-16
-------------------
- fixed `copy()` if source and dest are the same. [#230][#230]

0.26.6 / 2016-03-15
-------------------
- fixed if `emptyDir()` does not have a callback: [#229][#229]

0.26.5 / 2016-01-27
-------------------
- `copy()` with two arguments (w/o callback) was broken. See: [#215][#215]

0.26.4 / 2016-01-05
-------------------
- `copySync()` made `preserveTimestamps` default consistent with `copy()` which is `false`. See: [#208][#208]

0.26.3 / 2015-12-17
-------------------
- fixed `copy()` hangup in copying blockDevice / characterDevice / `/dev/null`. See: [#193][#193]

0.26.2 / 2015-11-02
-------------------
- fixed `outputJson{Sync}()` spacing adherence to `fs.spaces`

0.26.1 / 2015-11-02
-------------------
- fixed `copySync()` when `clogger=true` and the destination is read only. See: [#190][#190]

0.26.0 / 2015-10-25
-------------------
- extracted the `walk()` function into its own module [`klaw`](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw).

0.25.0 / 2015-10-24
-------------------
- now has a file walker `walk()`

0.24.0 / 2015-08-28
-------------------
- removed alias `delete()` and `deleteSync()`. See: [#171][#171]

0.23.1 / 2015-08-07
-------------------
- Better handling of errors for `move()` when moving across devices. [#170][#170]
- `ensureSymlink()` and `ensureLink()` should not throw errors if link exists. [#169][#169]

0.23.0 / 2015-08-06
-------------------
- added `ensureLink{Sync}()` and `ensureSymlink{Sync}()`. See: [#165][#165]

0.22.1 / 2015-07-09
-------------------
- Prevent calling `hasMillisResSync()` on module load. See: [#149][#149].
Fixes regression that was introduced in `0.21.0`.

0.22.0 / 2015-07-09
-------------------
- preserve permissions / ownership in `copy()`. See: [#54][#54]

0.21.0 / 2015-07-04
-------------------
- add option to preserve timestamps in `copy()` and `copySync()`. See: [#141][#141]
- updated `graceful-fs@3.x` to `4.x`. This brings in features from `amazing-graceful-fs` (much cleaner code / less hacks)

0.20.1 / 2015-06-23
-------------------
- fixed regression caused by latest jsonfile update: See: https://github.com/jprichardson/node-jsonfile/issues/26

0.20.0 / 2015-06-19
-------------------
- removed `jsonfile` aliases with `File` in the name, they weren't documented and probably weren't in use e.g.
this package had both `fs.readJsonFile` and `fs.readJson` that were aliases to each other, now use `fs.readJson`.
- preliminary walker created. Intentionally not documented. If you use it, it will almost certainly change and break your code.
- started moving tests inline
- upgraded to `jsonfile@2.1.0`, can now pass JSON revivers/replacers to `readJson()`, `writeJson()`, `outputJson()`

0.19.0 / 2015-06-08
-------------------
- `fs.copy()` had support for Node v0.8, dropped support

0.18.4 / 2015-05-22

- fixed a lot of tests for Windows (appveyor)

0.18.0 / 2015-03-31
-------------------
- added `emptyDir()` and `emptyDirSync()`

0.17.0 / 2015-03-28
-------------------
- `copySync` added `clobber` option (before always would clobber, now if `clobber` is `false` it throws an error if the destination exists).
**Only works with files at the moment.**
- `createOutputStream()` added. See: [#118][#118]

0.16.5 / 2015-03-08
-------------------
- fixed `fs.move` when `clobber` is `true` and destination is a directory, it should clobber. [#114][#114]

0.16.4 / 2015-03-01
-------------------
- `fs.mkdirs` fix infinite loop on Windows. See: See https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/pull/74 and https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/issues/66

0.16.3 / 2015-01-28
-------------------

-------------------
- fixed `fs.copy` for Node v0.8 (support is temporary and will be removed in the near future)

0.16.1 / 2015-01-28
-------------------
- if `setImmediate` is not available, fall back to `process.nextTick`

0.16.0 / 2015-01-28
-------------------
- bugfix `fs.move()` into itself. Closes [#104]
- bugfix `fs.move()` moving directory across device. Closes [#108]
- added coveralls support
- bugfix: nasty multiple callback `fs.copy()` bug. Closes [#98]

0.15.0 / 2015-01-21
-------------------
- dropped `ncp`, imported code in
- because of previous, now supports `io.js`
- `graceful-fs` is now a dependency

0.14.0 / 2015-01-05
-------------------
- changed `copy`/`copySync` from `fs.copy(src, dest, [filters], callback)` to `fs.copy(src, dest, [options], callback)` [#100][#100]
- removed mockfs tests for mkdirp (this may be temporary, but was getting in the way of other tests)

0.13.0 / 2014-12-10
-------------------
- removed `touch` and `touchSync` methods (they didn't handle permissions like UNIX touch)
- updated `"ncp": "^0.6.0"` to `"ncp": "^1.0.1"`
- imported `mkdirp` => `minimist` and `mkdirp` are no longer dependences, should now appease people who wanted `mkdirp` to be `--use_strict` safe. See [#59]([#59][#59])

0.12.0 / 2014-09-22
-------------------
- copy symlinks in `copySync()` [#85][#85]

0.11.1 / 2014-09-02
-------------------
- bugfix `copySync()` preserve file permissions [#80][#80]

0.11.0 / 2014-08-11
-------------------
- upgraded `"ncp": "^0.5.1"` to `"ncp": "^0.6.0"`
- upgrade `jsonfile": "^1.2.0"` to `jsonfile": "^2.0.0"` => on write, json files now have `\n` at end. Also adds `options.throws` to `readJsonSync()`

Node.js: fs-extra
=================

`fs-extra` adds file system methods that aren't included in the native `fs` module and adds promise support to the `fs` methods. It also uses [`graceful-fs`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-graceful-fs) to prevent `EMFILE` errors. It should be a drop in replacement for `fs`.

Why?
----

I got tired of including `mkdirp`, `rimraf`, and `ncp` in most of my projects.




Installation
------------

    npm install fs-extra



Usage
-----

`fs-extra` is a drop in replacement for native `fs`. All methods in `fs` are attached to `fs-extra`. All `fs` methods return promises if the callback isn't passed.

You don't ever need to include the original `fs` module again:

```js
const fs = require('fs') // this is no longer necessary
```

you can now do this:

```js
const fs = require('fs-extra')
```

or if you prefer to make it clear that you're using `fs-extra` and not `fs`, you may want
to name your `fs` variable `fse` like so:

```js
const fse = require('fs-extra')
```

you can also keep both, but it's redundant:

```js
const fs = require('fs')
const fse = require('fs-extra')
```

Sync vs Async vs Async/Await
-------------
Most methods are async by default. All async methods will return a promise if the callback isn't passed.

Sync methods on the other hand will throw if an error occurs.

Also Async/Await will throw an error if one occurs.

Example:

```js
const fs = require('fs-extra')

// Async with promises:
fs.copy('/tmp/myfile', '/tmp/mynewfile')
  .then(() => console.log('success!'))
  .catch(err => console.error(err))

// Async with callbacks:
fs.copy('/tmp/myfile', '/tmp/mynewfile', err => {
  if (err) return console.error(err)
  console.log('success!')
})

// Sync:
try {
  fs.copySync('/tmp/myfile', '/tmp/mynewfile')
  console.log('success!')
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err)
}

// Async/Await:
async function copyFiles () {
  try {
    await fs.copy('/tmp/myfile', '/tmp/mynewfile')
    console.log('success!')
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err)
  }
}

copyFiles()
```


Methods
-------

### Async

- [copy](docs/copy.md)
- [emptyDir](docs/emptyDir.md)
- [ensureFile](docs/ensureFile.md)
- [ensureDir](docs/ensureDir.md)
- [ensureLink](docs/ensureLink.md)
- [ensureSymlink](docs/ensureSymlink.md)
- [mkdirp](docs/ensureDir.md)
- [mkdirs](docs/ensureDir.md)
- [move](docs/move.md)
- [outputFile](docs/outputFile.md)
- [outputJson](docs/outputJson.md)
- [pathExists](docs/pathExists.md)
- [readJson](docs/readJson.md)
- [remove](docs/remove.md)
- [writeJson](docs/writeJson.md)

### Sync

- [copySync](docs/copy-sync.md)
- [emptyDirSync](docs/emptyDir-sync.md)
- [ensureFileSync](docs/ensureFile-sync.md)
- [ensureDirSync](docs/ensureDir-sync.md)
- [ensureLinkSync](docs/ensureLink-sync.md)
- [ensureSymlinkSync](docs/ensureSymlink-sync.md)
- [mkdirpSync](docs/ensureDir-sync.md)
- [mkdirsSync](docs/ensureDir-sync.md)
- [moveSync](docs/move-sync.md)
- [outputFileSync](docs/outputFile-sync.md)
- [outputJsonSync](docs/outputJson-sync.md)
- [pathExistsSync](docs/pathExists-sync.md)
- [readJsonSync](docs/readJson-sync.md)
- [removeSync](docs/remove-sync.md)
- [writeJsonSync](docs/writeJson-sync.md)


**NOTE:** You can still use the native Node.js methods. They are promisified and copied over to `fs-extra`. See [notes on `fs.read()`, `fs.write()`, & `fs.writev()`](docs/fs-read-write-writev.md)

### What happened to `walk()` and `walkSync()`?

They were removed from `fs-extra` in v2.0.0. If you need the functionality, `walk` and `walkSync` are available as separate packages, [`klaw`](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw) and [`klaw-sync`](https://github.com/manidlou/node-klaw-sync).


Third Party
-----------

### CLI

[fse-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atao60/fse-cli) allows you to run `fs-extra` from a console or from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) scripts.

### TypeScript

If you like TypeScript, you can use `fs-extra` with it: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/fs-extra


### File / Directory Watching

If you want to watch for changes to files or directories, then you should use [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar).

### Obtain Filesystem (Devices, Partitions) Information

[fs-filesystem](https://github.com/arthurintelligence/node-fs-filesystem) allows you to read the state of the filesystem of the host on which it is run. It returns information about both the devices and the partitions (volumes) of the system.

### Misc.

- [fs-extra-debug](https://github.com/jdxcode/fs-extra-debug) - Send your fs-extra calls to [debug](https://npmjs.org/package/debug).
- [mfs](https://github.com/cadorn/mfs) - Monitor your fs-extra calls.



Hacking on fs-extra
-------------------

Wanna hack on `fs-extra`? Great! Your help is needed! [fs-extra is one of the most depended upon Node.js packages](http://nodei.co/npm/fs-extra.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true). This project
uses [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/feross/standard) - if the name or style choices bother you,
you're gonna have to get over it :) If `standard` is good enough for `npm`, it's good enough for `fs-extra`.

[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

What's needed?
- First, take a look at existing issues. Those are probably going to be where the priority lies.
- More tests for edge cases. Specifically on different platforms. There can never be enough tests.
- Improve test coverage. See coveralls output for more info.

Note: If you make any big changes, **you should definitely file an issue for discussion first.**

### Running the Test Suite

fs-extra contains hundreds of tests.

- `npm run lint`: runs the linter ([standard](http://standardjs.com/))
- `npm run unit`: runs the unit tests
- `npm test`: runs both the linter and the tests


### Windows

If you run the tests on the Windows and receive a lot of symbolic link `EPERM` permission errors, it's
because on Windows you need elevated privilege to create symbolic links. You can add this to your Windows's
account by following the instructions here: http://superuser.com/questions/104845/permission-to-make-symbolic-links-in-windows-7
However, I didn't have much luck doing this.

Since I develop on Mac OS X, I use VMWare Fusion for Windows testing. I create a shared folder that I map to a drive on Windows.
I open the `Node.js command prompt` and run as `Administrator`. I then map the network drive running the following command:

    net use z: "\\vmware-host\Shared Folders"

I can then navigate to my `fs-extra` directory and run the tests.


Naming
------

I put a lot of thought into the naming of these functions. Inspired by @coolaj86's request. So he deserves much of the credit for raising the issue. See discussion(s) here:

* https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/2
* https://github.com/flatiron/utile/issues/11
* https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/wrench-js/issues/29
* https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/issues/17

First, I believe that in as many cases as possible, the [Node.js naming schemes](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) should be chosen. However, there are problems with the Node.js own naming schemes.

For example, `fs.readFile()` and `fs.readdir()`: the **F** is capitalized in *File* and the **d** is not capitalized in *dir*. Perhaps a bit pedantic, but they should still be consistent. Also, Node.js has chosen a lot of POSIX naming schemes, which I believe is great. See: `fs.mkdir()`, `fs.rmdir()`, `fs.chown()`, etc.

We have a dilemma though. How do you consistently name methods that perform the following POSIX commands: `cp`, `cp -r`, `mkdir -p`, and `rm -rf`?

My perspective: when in doubt, err on the side of simplicity. A directory is just a hierarchical grouping of directories and files. Consider that for a moment. So when you want to copy it or remove it, in most cases you'll want to copy or remove all of its contents. When you want to create a directory, if the directory that it's suppose to be contained in does not exist, then in most cases you'll want to create that too.

So, if you want to remove a file or a directory regardless of whether it has contents, just call `fs.remove(path)`. If you want to copy a file or a directory whether it has contents, just call `fs.copy(source, destination)`. If you want to create a directory regardless of whether its parent directories exist, just call `fs.mkdirs(path)` or `fs.mkdirp(path)`.

# fs.realpath

A backwards-compatible fs.realpath for Node v6 and above

In Node v6, the JavaScript implementation of fs.realpath was replaced
with a faster (but less resilient) native implementation.  That raises
new and platform-specific errors and cannot handle long or excessively
symlink-looping paths.

This module handles those cases by detecting the new errors and
falling back to the JavaScript implementation.  On versions of Node
prior to v6, it has no effect.

## USAGE

```js
var rp = require('fs.realpath')

// async version
rp.realpath(someLongAndLoopingPath, function (er, real) {
  // the ELOOP was handled, but it was a bit slower
})

// sync version
var real = rp.realpathSync(someLongAndLoopingPath)

// monkeypatch at your own risk!
// This replaces the fs.realpath/fs.realpathSync builtins
rp.monkeypatch()

// un-do the monkeypatching
rp.unmonkeypatch()
```

# get-caller-file

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stefanpenner/get-caller-file.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stefanpenner/get-caller-file)
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ol2q94g1932cy14a/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/embercli/get-caller-file/branch/master)

This is a utility, which allows a function to figure out from which file it was invoked. It does so by inspecting v8's stack trace at the time it is invoked.

Inspired by http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13227489

*note: this relies on Node/V8 specific APIs, as such other runtimes may not work*

## Installation

```bash
yarn add get-caller-file
```

## Usage

Given:

```js
// ./foo.js
const getCallerFile = require('get-caller-file');

module.exports = function() {
  return getCallerFile(); // figures out who called it
};
```

```js
// index.js
const foo = require('./foo');

foo() // => /full/path/to/this/file/index.js
```


## Options:

* `getCallerFile(position = 2)`: where position is stack frame whos fileName we want.

## API

The methods returns a promise that resolves when the `end` event fires on the stream, indicating that there is no more data to be read. The stream is switched to flowing mode.

### getStream(stream, [options])

Get the `stream` as a string.

#### options

Type: `Object`

##### encoding

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `utf8`

[Encoding](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer) of the incoming stream.

##### maxBuffer

Type: `number`<br>
Default: `Infinity`

Maximum length of the returned string. If it exceeds this value before the stream ends, the promise will be rejected with a `getStream.MaxBufferError` error.

### getStream.buffer(stream, [options])

Get the `stream` as a buffer.

It honors the `maxBuffer` option as above, but it refers to byte length rather than string length.

### getStream.array(stream, [options])

Get the `stream` as an array of values.

It honors both the `maxBuffer` and `encoding` options. The behavior changes slightly based on the encoding chosen:

- When `encoding` is unset, it assumes an [object mode stream](https://nodesource.com/blog/understanding-object-streams/) and collects values emitted from `stream` unmodified. In this case `maxBuffer` refers to the number of items in the array (not the sum of their sizes).

- When `encoding` is set to `buffer`, it collects an array of buffers. `maxBuffer` refers to the summed byte lengths of every buffer in the array.

- When `encoding` is set to anything else, it collects an array of strings. `maxBuffer` refers to the summed character lengths of every string in the array.


## Errors

If the input stream emits an `error` event, the promise will be rejected with the error. The buffered data will be attached to the `bufferedData` property of the error.

```js
(async () => {
	try {
		await getStream(streamThatErrorsAtTheEnd('unicorn'));
	} catch (error) {
		console.log(error.bufferedData);
		//=> 'unicorn'
	}
})()
```


## FAQ

### How is this different from [`concat-stream`](https://github.com/maxogden/concat-stream)?

This module accepts a stream instead of being one and returns a promise instead of using a callback. The API is simpler and it only supports returning a string, buffer, or array. It doesn't have a fragile type inference. You explicitly choose what you want. And it doesn't depend on the huge `readable-stream` package.

# glob-parent

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Downloads][downloads-image]][npm-url] [![Azure Pipelines Build Status][azure-pipelines-image]][azure-pipelines-url] [![Travis Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![AppVeyor Build Status][appveyor-image]][appveyor-url] [![Coveralls Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url] [![Gitter chat][gitter-image]][gitter-url]

Extract the non-magic parent path from a glob string.

## Usage

```js
var globParent = require('glob-parent');

globParent('path/to/*.js'); // 'path/to'
globParent('/root/path/to/*.js'); // '/root/path/to'
globParent('/*.js'); // '/'
globParent('*.js'); // '.'
globParent('**/*.js'); // '.'
globParent('path/{to,from}'); // 'path'
globParent('path/!(to|from)'); // 'path'
globParent('path/?(to|from)'); // 'path'
globParent('path/+(to|from)'); // 'path'
globParent('path/*(to|from)'); // 'path'
globParent('path/@(to|from)'); // 'path'
globParent('path/**/*'); // 'path'

// if provided a non-glob path, returns the nearest dir
globParent('path/foo/bar.js'); // 'path/foo'
globParent('path/foo/'); // 'path/foo'
globParent('path/foo'); // 'path' (see issue #3 for details)
```

## API

### `globParent(maybeGlobString, [options])`

Takes a string and returns the part of the path before the glob begins. Be aware of Escaping rules and Limitations below.

#### options

```js
{
  // Disables the automatic conversion of slashes for Windows
  flipBackslashes: true
}
```

## Escaping

The following characters have special significance in glob patterns and must be escaped if you want them to be treated as regular path characters:

- `?` (question mark) unless used as a path segment alone
- `*` (asterisk)
- `|` (pipe)
- `(` (opening parenthesis)
- `)` (closing parenthesis)
- `{` (opening curly brace)
- `}` (closing curly brace)
- `[` (opening bracket)
- `]` (closing bracket)

**Example**

```js
globParent('foo/[bar]/') // 'foo'
globParent('foo/\\[bar]/') // 'foo/[bar]'
```

## Limitations

### Braces & Brackets
This library attempts a quick and imperfect method of determining which path
parts have glob magic without fully parsing/lexing the pattern. There are some
advanced use cases that can trip it up, such as nested braces where the outer
pair is escaped and the inner one contains a path separator. If you find
yourself in the unlikely circumstance of being affected by this or need to
ensure higher-fidelity glob handling in your library, it is recommended that you
pre-process your input with [expand-braces] and/or [expand-brackets].

### Windows
Backslashes are not valid path separators for globs. If a path with backslashes
is provided anyway, for simple cases, glob-parent will replace the path
separator for you and return the non-glob parent path (now with
forward-slashes, which are still valid as Windows path separators).

This cannot be used in conjunction with escape characters.

```js
// BAD
globParent('C:\\Program Files \\(x86\\)\\*.ext') // 'C:/Program Files /(x86/)'

// GOOD
globParent('C:/Program Files\\(x86\\)/*.ext') // 'C:/Program Files (x86)'
```

If you are using escape characters for a pattern without path parts (i.e.
relative to `cwd`), prefix with `./` to avoid confusing glob-parent.

```js
// BAD
globParent('foo \\[bar]') // 'foo '
globParent('foo \\[bar]*') // 'foo '

// GOOD
globParent('./foo \\[bar]') // 'foo [bar]'
globParent('./foo \\[bar]*') // '.'
```

# Glob

Match files using the patterns the shell uses, like stars and stuff.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/isaacs/node-glob.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/isaacs/node-glob/) [![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/kd7f3yftf7unxlsx?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/isaacs/node-glob) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/isaacs/node-glob/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/isaacs/node-glob?branch=master)

This is a glob implementation in JavaScript.  It uses the `minimatch`
library to do its matching.

![](logo/glob.png)

## Usage

Install with npm

```
npm i glob
```

```javascript
var glob = require("glob")

// options is optional
glob("**/*.js", options, function (er, files) {
  // files is an array of filenames.
  // If the `nonull` option is set, and nothing
  // was found, then files is ["**/*.js"]
  // er is an error object or null.
})
```

## Glob Primer

"Globs" are the patterns you type when you do stuff like `ls *.js` on
the command line, or put `build/*` in a `.gitignore` file.

Before parsing the path part patterns, braced sections are expanded
into a set.  Braced sections start with `{` and end with `}`, with any
number of comma-delimited sections within.  Braced sections may contain
slash characters, so `a{/b/c,bcd}` would expand into `a/b/c` and `abcd`.

The following characters have special magic meaning when used in a
path portion:

* `*` Matches 0 or more characters in a single path portion
* `?` Matches 1 character
* `[...]` Matches a range of characters, similar to a RegExp range.
  If the first character of the range is `!` or `^` then it matches
  any character not in the range.
* `!(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches anything that does not match
  any of the patterns provided.
* `?(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches zero or one occurrence of the
  patterns provided.
* `+(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches one or more occurrences of the
  patterns provided.
* `*(a|b|c)` Matches zero or more occurrences of the patterns provided
* `@(pattern|pat*|pat?erN)` Matches exactly one of the patterns
  provided
* `**` If a "globstar" is alone in a path portion, then it matches
  zero or more directories and subdirectories searching for matches.
  It does not crawl symlinked directories.

### Dots

If a file or directory path portion has a `.` as the first character,
then it will not match any glob pattern unless that pattern's
corresponding path part also has a `.` as its first character.

For example, the pattern `a/.*/c` would match the file at `a/.b/c`.
However the pattern `a/*/c` would not, because `*` does not start with
a dot character.

You can make glob treat dots as normal characters by setting
`dot:true` in the options.

### Basename Matching

If you set `matchBase:true` in the options, and the pattern has no
slashes in it, then it will seek for any file anywhere in the tree
with a matching basename.  For example, `*.js` would match
`test/simple/basic.js`.

### Empty Sets

If no matching files are found, then an empty array is returned.  This
differs from the shell, where the pattern itself is returned.  For
example:

    $ echo a*s*d*f
    a*s*d*f

To get the bash-style behavior, set the `nonull:true` in the options.

### See Also:

* `man sh`
* `man bash` (Search for "Pattern Matching")
* `man 3 fnmatch`
* `man 5 gitignore`
* [minimatch documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)

## glob.hasMagic(pattern, [options])

Returns `true` if there are any special characters in the pattern, and
`false` otherwise.

Note that the options affect the results.  If `noext:true` is set in
the options object, then `+(a|b)` will not be considered a magic
pattern.  If the pattern has a brace expansion, like `a/{b/c,x/y}`
then that is considered magical, unless `nobrace:true` is set in the
options.

## glob(pattern, [options], cb)

* `pattern` `{String}` Pattern to be matched
* `options` `{Object}`
* `cb` `{Function}`
  * `err` `{Error | null}`
  * `matches` `{Array<String>}` filenames found matching the pattern

Perform an asynchronous glob search.

## glob.sync(pattern, [options])

* `pattern` `{String}` Pattern to be matched
* `options` `{Object}`
* return: `{Array<String>}` filenames found matching the pattern

Perform a synchronous glob search.

## Class: glob.Glob

Create a Glob object by instantiating the `glob.Glob` class.

```javascript
var Glob = require("glob").Glob
var mg = new Glob(pattern, options, cb)
```

It's an EventEmitter, and starts walking the filesystem to find matches
immediately.

### new glob.Glob(pattern, [options], [cb])

* `pattern` `{String}` pattern to search for
* `options` `{Object}`
* `cb` `{Function}` Called when an error occurs, or matches are found
  * `err` `{Error | null}`
  * `matches` `{Array<String>}` filenames found matching the pattern

Note that if the `sync` flag is set in the options, then matches will
be immediately available on the `g.found` member.

### Properties

* `minimatch` The minimatch object that the glob uses.
* `options` The options object passed in.
* `aborted` Boolean which is set to true when calling `abort()`.  There
  is no way at this time to continue a glob search after aborting, but
  you can re-use the statCache to avoid having to duplicate syscalls.
* `cache` Convenience object.  Each field has the following possible
  values:
  * `false` - Path does not exist
  * `true` - Path exists
  * `'FILE'` - Path exists, and is not a directory
  * `'DIR'` - Path exists, and is a directory
  * `[file, entries, ...]` - Path exists, is a directory, and the
    array value is the results of `fs.readdir`
* `statCache` Cache of `fs.stat` results, to prevent statting the same
  path multiple times.
* `symlinks` A record of which paths are symbolic links, which is
  relevant in resolving `**` patterns.
* `realpathCache` An optional object which is passed to `fs.realpath`
  to minimize unnecessary syscalls.  It is stored on the instantiated
  Glob object, and may be re-used.

### Events

* `end` When the matching is finished, this is emitted with all the
  matches found.  If the `nonull` option is set, and no match was found,
  then the `matches` list contains the original pattern.  The matches
  are sorted, unless the `nosort` flag is set.
* `match` Every time a match is found, this is emitted with the specific
  thing that matched. It is not deduplicated or resolved to a realpath.
* `error` Emitted when an unexpected error is encountered, or whenever
  any fs error occurs if `options.strict` is set.
* `abort` When `abort()` is called, this event is raised.

### Methods

* `pause` Temporarily stop the search
* `resume` Resume the search
* `abort` Stop the search forever

### Options

All the options that can be passed to Minimatch can also be passed to
Glob to change pattern matching behavior.  Also, some have been added,
or have glob-specific ramifications.

All options are false by default, unless otherwise noted.

All options are added to the Glob object, as well.

If you are running many `glob` operations, you can pass a Glob object
as the `options` argument to a subsequent operation to shortcut some
`stat` and `readdir` calls.  At the very least, you may pass in shared
`symlinks`, `statCache`, `realpathCache`, and `cache` options, so that
parallel glob operations will be sped up by sharing information about
the filesystem.

* `cwd` The current working directory in which to search.  Defaults
  to `process.cwd()`.
* `root` The place where patterns starting with `/` will be mounted
  onto.  Defaults to `path.resolve(options.cwd, "/")` (`/` on Unix
  systems, and `C:\` or some such on Windows.)
* `dot` Include `.dot` files in normal matches and `globstar` matches.
  Note that an explicit dot in a portion of the pattern will always
  match dot files.
* `nomount` By default, a pattern starting with a forward-slash will be
  "mounted" onto the root setting, so that a valid filesystem path is
  returned.  Set this flag to disable that behavior.
* `mark` Add a `/` character to directory matches.  Note that this
  requires additional stat calls.
* `nosort` Don't sort the results.
* `stat` Set to true to stat *all* results.  This reduces performance
  somewhat, and is completely unnecessary, unless `readdir` is presumed
  to be an untrustworthy indicator of file existence.
* `silent` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to
  read a directory, a warning will be printed to stderr.  Set the
  `silent` option to true to suppress these warnings.
* `strict` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to
  read a directory, the process will just continue on in search of
  other matches.  Set the `strict` option to raise an error in these
  cases.
* `cache` See `cache` property above.  Pass in a previously generated
  cache object to save some fs calls.
* `statCache` A cache of results of filesystem information, to prevent
  unnecessary stat calls.  While it should not normally be necessary
  to set this, you may pass the statCache from one glob() call to the
  options object of another, if you know that the filesystem will not
  change between calls.  (See "Race Conditions" below.)
* `symlinks` A cache of known symbolic links.  You may pass in a
  previously generated `symlinks` object to save `lstat` calls when
  resolving `**` matches.
* `sync` DEPRECATED: use `glob.sync(pattern, opts)` instead.
* `nounique` In some cases, brace-expanded patterns can result in the
  same file showing up multiple times in the result set.  By default,
  this implementation prevents duplicates in the result set.  Set this
  flag to disable that behavior.
* `nonull` Set to never return an empty set, instead returning a set
  containing the pattern itself.  This is the default in glob(3).
* `debug` Set to enable debug logging in minimatch and glob.
* `nobrace` Do not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.
* `noglobstar` Do not match `**` against multiple filenames.  (Ie,
  treat it as a normal `*` instead.)
* `noext` Do not match `+(a|b)` "extglob" patterns.
* `nocase` Perform a case-insensitive match.  Note: on
  case-insensitive filesystems, non-magic patterns will match by
  default, since `stat` and `readdir` will not raise errors.
* `matchBase` Perform a basename-only match if the pattern does not
  contain any slash characters.  That is, `*.js` would be treated as
  equivalent to `**/*.js`, matching all js files in all directories.
* `nodir` Do not match directories, only files.  (Note: to match
  *only* directories, simply put a `/` at the end of the pattern.)
* `ignore` Add a pattern or an array of glob patterns to exclude matches.
  Note: `ignore` patterns are *always* in `dot:true` mode, regardless
  of any other settings.
* `follow` Follow symlinked directories when expanding `**` patterns.
  Note that this can result in a lot of duplicate references in the
  presence of cyclic links.
* `realpath` Set to true to call `fs.realpath` on all of the results.
  In the case of a symlink that cannot be resolved, the full absolute
  path to the matched entry is returned (though it will usually be a
  broken symlink)
* `absolute` Set to true to always receive absolute paths for matched
  files.  Unlike `realpath`, this also affects the values returned in
  the `match` event.

## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations

While strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile
goal, some discrepancies exist between node-glob and other
implementations, and are intentional.

The double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless the
`noglobstar` flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob
and bash 4.3, where `**` only has special significance if it is the only
thing in a path part.  That is, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/b`, but
`a/**b` will not.

Note that symlinked directories are not crawled as part of a `**`,
though their contents may match against subsequent portions of the
pattern.  This prevents infinite loops and duplicates and the like.

If an escaped pattern has no matches, and the `nonull` flag is set,
then glob returns the pattern as-provided, rather than
interpreting the character escapes.  For example,
`glob.match([], "\\*a\\?")` will return `"\\*a\\?"` rather than
`"*a?"`.  This is akin to setting the `nullglob` option in bash, except
that it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.

If brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any
other interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like
`+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded
**first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and those patterns are
checked for validity.  Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.

### Comments and Negation

Previously, this module let you mark a pattern as a "comment" if it
started with a `#` character, or a "negated" pattern if it started
with a `!` character.

These options were deprecated in version 5, and removed in version 6.

To specify things that should not match, use the `ignore` option.

## Windows

**Please only use forward-slashes in glob expressions.**

Though windows uses either `/` or `\` as its path separator, only `/`
characters are used by this glob implementation.  You must use
forward-slashes **only** in glob expressions.  Back-slashes will always
be interpreted as escape characters, not path separators.

Results from absolute patterns such as `/foo/*` are mounted onto the
root setting using `path.join`.  On windows, this will by default result
in `/foo/*` matching `C:\foo\bar.txt`.

## Race Conditions

Glob searching, by its very nature, is susceptible to race conditions,
since it relies on directory walking and such.

As a result, it is possible that a file that exists when glob looks for
it may have been deleted or modified by the time it returns the result.

As part of its internal implementation, this program caches all stat
and readdir calls that it makes, in order to cut down on system
overhead.  However, this also makes it even more susceptible to races,
especially if the cache or statCache objects are reused between glob
calls.

Users are thus advised not to use a glob result as a guarantee of
filesystem state in the face of rapid changes.  For the vast majority
of operations, this is never a problem.

## Usage

```js
const got = require('got');

(async () => {
	try {
		const response = await got('sindresorhus.com');
		console.log(response.body);
		//=> '<!doctype html> ...'
	} catch (error) {
		console.log(error.response.body);
		//=> 'Internal server error ...'
	}
})();
```

###### Streams

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const got = require('got');

got.stream('sindresorhus.com').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('index.html'));

// For POST, PUT, and PATCH methods `got.stream` returns a `stream.Writable`
fs.createReadStream('index.html').pipe(got.stream.post('sindresorhus.com'));
```


### API

It's a `GET` request by default, but can be changed by using different methods or in the `options`.

#### got(url, [options])

Returns a Promise for a [`response` object](#response) or a [stream](#streams-1) if `options.stream` is set to true.

##### url

Type: `string` `Object`

The URL to request, as a string, a [`https.request` options object](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_request_options_callback), or a [WHATWG `URL`](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_class_url).

Properties from `options` will override properties in the parsed `url`.

If no protocol is specified, it will default to `https`.

##### options

Type: `Object`

Any of the [`https.request`](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_request_options_callback) options.

###### baseUrl

Type: `string` `Object`

When specified, `url` will be prepended by `baseUrl`.<br>
If you specify an absolute URL, it will skip the `baseUrl`.

Very useful when used with `got.extend()` to create niche-specific Got instances.

Can be a string or a [WHATWG `URL`](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_class_url).

Slash at the end of `baseUrl` and at the beginning of the `url` argument is optional:

```js
await got('hello', {baseUrl: 'https://example.com/v1'});
//=> 'https://example.com/v1/hello'

await got('/hello', {baseUrl: 'https://example.com/v1/'});
//=> 'https://example.com/v1/hello'

await got('/hello', {baseUrl: 'https://example.com/v1'});
//=> 'https://example.com/v1/hello'
```

###### headers

Type: `Object`<br>
Default: `{}`

Request headers.

Existing headers will be overwritten. Headers set to `null` will be omitted.

###### stream

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Returns a `Stream` instead of a `Promise`. This is equivalent to calling `got.stream(url, [options])`.

###### body

Type: `string` `Buffer` `stream.Readable` [`form-data` instance](https://github.com/form-data/form-data)

**Note:** If you provide this option, `got.stream()` will be read-only.

The body that will be sent with a `POST` request.

If present in `options` and `options.method` is not set, `options.method` will be set to `POST`.

The `content-length` header will be automatically set if `body` is a `string` / `Buffer` / `fs.createReadStream` instance / [`form-data` instance](https://github.com/form-data/form-data), and `content-length` and `transfer-encoding` are not manually set in `options.headers`.

###### cookieJar

Type: [`tough.CookieJar` instance](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie#cookiejar)

**Note:** If you provide this option, `options.headers.cookie` will be overridden.

Cookie support. You don't have to care about parsing or how to store them. [Example.](#cookies)

###### encoding

Type: `string` `null`<br>
Default: `'utf8'`

[Encoding](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffers_and_character_encodings) to be used on `setEncoding` of the response data. If `null`, the body is returned as a [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) (binary data).

###### form

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

**Note:** If you provide this option, `got.stream()` will be read-only.
**Note:** `body` must be a plain object. It will be converted to a query string using [`(new URLSearchParams(object)).toString()`](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_constructor_new_urlsearchparams_obj).

If set to `true` and `Content-Type` header is not set, it will be set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

###### json

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

**Note:** If you use `got.stream()`, this option will be ignored.
**Note:** `body` must be a plain object or array and will be stringified.

If set to `true` and `Content-Type` header is not set, it will be set to `application/json`.

Parse response body with `JSON.parse` and set `accept` header to `application/json`. If used in conjunction with the `form` option, the `body` will the stringified as querystring and the response parsed as JSON.

###### query

Type: `string` `Object<string, string|number>` [`URLSearchParams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams)

Query string that will be added to the request URL. This will override the query string in `url`.

If you need to pass in an array, you can do it using a `URLSearchParams` instance:

```js
const got = require('got');

const query = new URLSearchParams([['key', 'a'], ['key', 'b']]);

got('https://example.com', {query});

console.log(query.toString());
//=> 'key=a&key=b'
```

And if you need a different array format, you could use the [`query-string`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/query-string) package:

```js
const got = require('got');
const queryString = require('query-string');

const query = queryString.stringify({key: ['a', 'b']}, {arrayFormat: 'bracket'});

got('https://example.com', {query});

console.log(query);
//=> 'key[]=a&key[]=b'
```

###### timeout

Type: `number` `Object`

Milliseconds to wait for the server to end the response before aborting the request with [`got.TimeoutError`](#gottimeouterror) error (a.k.a. `request` property). By default, there's no timeout.

This also accepts an `object` with the following fields to constrain the duration of each phase of the request lifecycle:

- `lookup` starts when a socket is assigned and ends when the hostname has been resolved. Does not apply when using a Unix domain socket.
- `connect` starts when `lookup` completes (or when the socket is assigned if lookup does not apply to the request) and ends when the socket is connected.
- `secureConnect` starts when `connect` completes and ends when the handshaking process completes (HTTPS only).
- `socket` starts when the socket is connected. See [request.setTimeout](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_request_settimeout_timeout_callback).
- `response` starts when the request has been written to the socket and ends when the response headers are received.
- `send` starts when the socket is connected and ends with the request has been written to the socket.
- `request` starts when the request is initiated and ends when the response's end event fires.

###### retry

Type: `number` `Object`<br>
Default:
- retries: `2`
- methods: `GET` `PUT` `HEAD` `DELETE` `OPTIONS` `TRACE`
- statusCodes: [`408`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) [`413`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/413) [`429`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) [`500`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) [`502`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/502) [`503`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/503) [`504`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/504)
- maxRetryAfter: `undefined`
- errorCodes: `ETIMEDOUT` `ECONNRESET` `EADDRINUSE` `ECONNREFUSED` `EPIPE` `ENOTFOUND` `ENETUNREACH` `EAI_AGAIN`

An object representing `retries`, `methods`, `statusCodes`, `maxRetryAfter` and `errorCodes` fields for the time until retry, allowed methods, allowed status codes, maximum [`Retry-After`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After) time and allowed error codes.

If `maxRetryAfter` is set to `undefined`, it will use `options.timeout`.<br>
If [`Retry-After`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After) header is greater than `maxRetryAfter`, it will cancel the request.

Delays between retries counts with function `1000 * Math.pow(2, retry) + Math.random() * 100`, where `retry` is attempt number (starts from 1).

The `retries` property can be a `number` or a `function` with `retry` and `error` arguments. The function must return a delay in milliseconds (`0` return value cancels retry).

By default, it retries *only* on the specified methods, status codes, and on these network errors:
- `ETIMEDOUT`: One of the [timeout](#timeout) limits were reached.
- `ECONNRESET`: Connection was forcibly closed by a peer.
- `EADDRINUSE`: Could not bind to any free port.
- `ECONNREFUSED`: Connection was refused by the server.
- `EPIPE`: The remote side of the stream being written has been closed.
- `ENOTFOUND`: Couldn't resolve the hostname to an IP address.
- `ENETUNREACH`: No internet connection.
- `EAI_AGAIN`: DNS lookup timed out.

###### followRedirect

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

Defines if redirect responses should be followed automatically.

Note that if a `303` is sent by the server in response to any request type (`POST`, `DELETE`, etc.), Got will automatically request the resource pointed to in the location header via `GET`. This is in accordance with [the spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.4).

###### decompress

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

Decompress the response automatically. This will set the `accept-encoding` header to `gzip, deflate` unless you set it yourself.

If this is disabled, a compressed response is returned as a `Buffer`. This may be useful if you want to handle decompression yourself or stream the raw compressed data.

###### cache

Type: `Object`<br>
Default: `false`

[Cache adapter instance](#cache-adapters) for storing cached data.

###### request

Type: `Function`<br>
Default: `http.request` `https.request` *(depending on the protocol)*

Custom request function. The main purpose of this is to [support HTTP2 using a wrapper](#experimental-http2-support).

###### useElectronNet

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

When used in Electron, Got will use [`electron.net`](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/net/) instead of the Node.js `http` module. According to the Electron docs, it should be fully compatible, but it's not entirely. See [#443](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/443) and [#461](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/461).

###### throwHttpErrors

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

Determines if a `got.HTTPError` is thrown for error responses (non-2xx status codes).

If this is disabled, requests that encounter an error status code will be resolved with the `response` instead of throwing. This may be useful if you are checking for resource availability and are expecting error responses.

###### agent

Same as the [`agent` option](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_request_url_options_callback) for `http.request`, but with an extra feature:

If you require different agents for different protocols, you can pass a map of agents to the `agent` option. This is necessary because a request to one protocol might redirect to another. In such a scenario, Got will switch over to the right protocol agent for you.

```js
const got = require('got');
const HttpAgent = require('agentkeepalive');
const {HttpsAgent} = HttpAgent;

got('sindresorhus.com', {
	agent: {
		http: new HttpAgent(),
		https: new HttpsAgent()
	}
});
```

###### hooks

Type: `Object<string, Function[]>`

Hooks allow modifications during the request lifecycle. Hook functions may be async and are run serially.

###### hooks.init

Type: `Function[]`<br>
Default: `[]`

Called with plain [request options](#options), right before their normalization. This is especially useful in conjunction with [`got.extend()`](#instances) and [`got.create()`](advanced-creation.md) when the input needs custom handling.

See the [Request migration guide](migration-guides.md#breaking-changes) for an example.

**Note**: This hook must be synchronous!

###### hooks.beforeRequest

Type: `Function[]`<br>
Default: `[]`

Called with [normalized](source/normalize-arguments.js) [request options](#options). Got will make no further changes to the request before it is sent. This is especially useful in conjunction with [`got.extend()`](#instances) and [`got.create()`](advanced-creation.md) when you want to create an API client that, for example, uses HMAC-signing.

See the [AWS section](#aws) for an example.

**Note:** If you modify the `body` you will need to modify the `content-length` header too, because it has already been computed and assigned.

###### hooks.beforeRedirect

Type: `Function[]`<br>
Default: `[]`

Called with [normalized](source/normalize-arguments.js) [request options](#options). Got will make no further changes to the request. This is especially useful when you want to avoid dead sites. Example:

```js
const got = require('got');

got('example.com', {
	hooks: {
		beforeRedirect: [
			options => {
				if (options.hostname === 'deadSite') {
					options.hostname = 'fallbackSite';
				}
			}
		]
	}
});
```

###### hooks.beforeRetry

Type: `Function[]`<br>
Default: `[]`

Called with [normalized](source/normalize-arguments.js) [request options](#options), the error and the retry count. Got will make no further changes to the request. This is especially useful when some extra work is required before the next try. Example:

```js
const got = require('got');

got('example.com', {
	hooks: {
		beforeRetry: [
			(options, error, retryCount) => {
				if (error.statusCode === 413) { // Payload too large
					options.body = getNewBody();
				}
			}
		]
	}
});
```

###### hooks.afterResponse

Type: `Function[]`<br>
Default: `[]`

Called with [response object](#response) and a retry function.

Each function should return the response. This is especially useful when you want to refresh an access token. Example:

```js
const got = require('got');

const instance = got.extend({
	hooks: {
		afterResponse: [
			(response, retryWithMergedOptions) => {
				if (response.statusCode === 401) { // Unauthorized
					const updatedOptions = {
						headers: {
							token: getNewToken() // Refresh the access token
						}
					};

					// Save for further requests
					instance.defaults.options = got.mergeOptions(instance.defaults.options, updatedOptions);

					// Make a new retry
					return retryWithMergedOptions(updatedOptions);
				}

				// No changes otherwise
				return response;
			}
		]
	},
	mutableDefaults: true
});
```

###### hooks.beforeError

Type: `Function[]`<br>
Default: `[]`

Called with an `Error` instance. The error is passed to the hook right before it's thrown. This is especially useful when you want to have more detailed errors.

**Note**: Errors thrown while normalizing input options are thrown directly and not part of this hook.

```js	
const got = require('got');	

got('api.github.com/some-endpoint', {	
	hooks: {	
		onError: [	
			error => {	
				const {response} = error;	
 				if (response && response.body) {	
					error.name = 'GitHubError';	
					error.message = `${response.body.message} (${error.statusCode})`;	
				}

 				return error;	
			}	
		]	
	}	
});	
```

#### Response

The response object will typically be a [Node.js HTTP response stream](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), however, if returned from the cache it will be a [response-like object](https://github.com/lukechilds/responselike) which behaves in the same way.

##### request

Type: `Object`

**Note:** This is not a [http.ClientRequest](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_clientrequest).

- `gotOptions` - The options that were set on this request.

##### body

Type: `string` `Object` *(depending on `options.json`)*

The result of the request.

##### url

Type: `string`

The request URL or the final URL after redirects.

##### requestUrl

Type: `string`

The original request URL.

##### timings

Type: `Object`

The object contains the following properties:

- `start` - Time when the request started.
- `socket` - Time when a socket was assigned to the request.
- `lookup` - Time when the DNS lookup finished.
- `connect` - Time when the socket successfully connected.
- `upload` - Time when the request finished uploading.
- `response` - Time when the request fired the `response` event.
- `end` - Time when the response fired the `end` event.
- `error` - Time when the request fired the `error` event.
- `phases`
	- `wait` - `timings.socket - timings.start`
	- `dns` - `timings.lookup - timings.socket`
	- `tcp` - `timings.connect - timings.lookup`
	- `request` - `timings.upload - timings.connect`
	- `firstByte` - `timings.response - timings.upload`
	- `download` - `timings.end - timings.response`
	- `total` - `timings.end - timings.start` or `timings.error - timings.start`

**Note:** The time is a `number` representing the milliseconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch.

##### fromCache

Type: `boolean`

Whether the response was retrieved from the cache.

##### redirectUrls

Type: `Array`

The redirect URLs.

##### retryCount

Type: `number`

The number of times the request was retried.

#### Streams

**Note:** Progress events, redirect events and request/response events can also be used with promises.

#### got.stream(url, [options])

Sets `options.stream` to `true`.

Returns a [duplex stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_duplex) with additional events:

##### .on('request', request)

`request` event to get the request object of the request.

**Tip:** You can use `request` event to abort request:

```js
got.stream('github.com')
	.on('request', request => setTimeout(() => request.abort(), 50));
```

##### .on('response', response)

The `response` event to get the response object of the final request.

##### .on('redirect', response, nextOptions)

The `redirect` event to get the response object of a redirect. The second argument is options for the next request to the redirect location.

##### .on('uploadProgress', progress)
##### .on('downloadProgress', progress)

Progress events for uploading (sending a request) and downloading (receiving a response). The `progress` argument is an object like:

```js
{
	percent: 0.1,
	transferred: 1024,
	total: 10240
}
```

If it's not possible to retrieve the body size (can happen when streaming), `total` will be `null`.

```js
(async () => {
	const response = await got('sindresorhus.com')
		.on('downloadProgress', progress => {
			// Report download progress
		})
		.on('uploadProgress', progress => {
			// Report upload progress
		});

	console.log(response);
})();
```

##### .on('error', error, body, response)

The `error` event emitted in case of a protocol error (like `ENOTFOUND` etc.) or status error (4xx or 5xx). The second argument is the body of the server response in case of status error. The third argument is a response object.

#### got.get(url, [options])
#### got.post(url, [options])
#### got.put(url, [options])
#### got.patch(url, [options])
#### got.head(url, [options])
#### got.delete(url, [options])

Sets `options.method` to the method name and makes a request.

### Instances

#### got.extend([options])

Configure a new `got` instance with default `options`. The `options` are merged with the parent instance's `defaults.options` using [`got.mergeOptions`](#gotmergeoptionsparentoptions-newoptions). You can access the resolved options with the `.defaults` property on the instance.

```js
const client = got.extend({
	baseUrl: 'https://example.com',
	headers: {
		'x-unicorn': 'rainbow'
	}
});

client.get('/demo');

/* HTTP Request =>
 * GET /demo HTTP/1.1
 * Host: example.com
 * x-unicorn: rainbow
 */
```

```js
(async () => {
	const client = got.extend({
		baseUrl: 'httpbin.org',
		headers: {
			'x-foo': 'bar'
		}
	});
	const {headers} = (await client.get('/headers', {json: true})).body;
	//=> headers['x-foo'] === 'bar'

	const jsonClient = client.extend({
		json: true,
		headers: {
			'x-baz': 'qux'
		}
	});
	const {headers: headers2} = (await jsonClient.get('/headers')).body;
	//=> headers2['x-foo'] === 'bar'
	//=> headers2['x-baz'] === 'qux'
})();
```

**Tip:** Need more control over the behavior of Got? Check out the [`got.create()`](advanced-creation.md).

#### got.mergeOptions(parentOptions, newOptions)

Extends parent options. Avoid using [object spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#Spread_in_object_literals) as it doesn't work recursively:

```js
const a = {headers: {cat: 'meow', wolf: ['bark', 'wrrr']}};
const b = {headers: {cow: 'moo', wolf: ['auuu']}};

{...a, ...b}            // => {headers: {cow: 'moo', wolf: ['auuu']}}
got.mergeOptions(a, b)  // => {headers: {cat: 'meow', cow: 'moo', wolf: ['auuu']}}
```

Options are deeply merged to a new object. The value of each key is determined as follows:

- If the new property is set to `undefined`, it keeps the old one.
- If the parent property is an instance of `URL` and the new value is a `string` or `URL`, a new URL instance is created: [`new URL(new, parent)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL#Syntax).
- If the new property is a plain `Object`:
	- If the parent property is a plain `Object` too, both values are merged recursively into a new `Object`.
	- Otherwise, only the new value is deeply cloned.
- If the new property is an `Array`, it overwrites the old one with a deep clone of the new property.
- Otherwise, the new value is assigned to the key.

#### got.defaults

Type: `Object`

The default Got options.

## Errors

Each error contains `host`, `hostname`, `method`, `path`, `protocol`, `url` and `gotOptions` properties to make debugging easier.

In Promise mode, the `response` is attached to the error.

#### got.CacheError

When a cache method fails, for example, if the database goes down or there's a filesystem error.

#### got.RequestError

When a request fails. Contains a `code` property with error class code, like `ECONNREFUSED`.

#### got.ReadError

When reading from response stream fails.

#### got.ParseError

When `json` option is enabled, server response code is 2xx, and `JSON.parse` fails. Includes `statusCode` and `statusMessage` properties.

#### got.HTTPError

When the server response code is not 2xx. Includes `body`, `statusCode`, `statusMessage`, and `redirectUrls` properties.

#### got.MaxRedirectsError

When the server redirects you more than ten times. Includes a `statusCode`, `statusMessage`, and `redirectUrls` property which is an array of the URLs Got was redirected to before giving up.

#### got.UnsupportedProtocolError

When given an unsupported protocol.

#### got.CancelError

When the request is aborted with `.cancel()`.

#### got.TimeoutError

When the request is aborted due to a [timeout](#timeout). Includes an `event` property.

## Aborting the request

The promise returned by Got has a [`.cancel()`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-cancelable) method which when called, aborts the request.

```js
(async () => {
	const request = got(url, options);

	// …

	// In another part of the code
	if (something) {
		request.cancel();
	}

	// …

	try {
		await request;
	} catch (error) {
		if (request.isCanceled) { // Or `error instanceof got.CancelError`
			// Handle cancelation
		}

		// Handle other errors
	}
})();
```

## Cache

Got implements [RFC 7234](http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html) compliant HTTP caching which works out of the box in-memory and is easily pluggable with a wide range of storage adapters. Fresh cache entries are served directly from the cache, and stale cache entries are revalidated with `If-None-Match`/`If-Modified-Since` headers. You can read more about the underlying cache behavior in the [`cacheable-request` documentation](https://github.com/lukechilds/cacheable-request).

You can use the JavaScript `Map` type as an in-memory cache:

```js
const got = require('got');
const map = new Map();

(async () => {
		let response = await got('sindresorhus.com', {cache: map});
		console.log(response.fromCache);
		//=> false

		response = await got('sindresorhus.com', {cache: map});
		console.log(response.fromCache);
		//=> true
})();
```

Got uses [Keyv](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv) internally to support a wide range of storage adapters. For something more scalable you could use an [official Keyv storage adapter](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv#official-storage-adapters):

```
$ npm install @keyv/redis
```

```js
const got = require('got');
const KeyvRedis = require('@keyv/redis');

const redis = new KeyvRedis('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379');

got('sindresorhus.com', {cache: redis});
```

Got supports anything that follows the Map API, so it's easy to write your own storage adapter or use a third-party solution.

For example, the following are all valid storage adapters:

```js
const storageAdapter = new Map();
// Or
const storageAdapter = require('./my-storage-adapter');
// Or
const QuickLRU = require('quick-lru');
const storageAdapter = new QuickLRU({maxSize: 1000});

got('sindresorhus.com', {cache: storageAdapter});
```

View the [Keyv docs](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv) for more information on how to use storage adapters.


## Proxies

You can use the [`tunnel`](https://github.com/koichik/node-tunnel) package with the `agent` option to work with proxies:

```js
const got = require('got');
const tunnel = require('tunnel');

got('sindresorhus.com', {
	agent: tunnel.httpOverHttp({
		proxy: {
			host: 'localhost'
		}
	})
});
```

Check out [`global-tunnel`](https://github.com/np-maintain/global-tunnel) if you want to configure proxy support for all HTTP/HTTPS traffic in your app.


## Cookies

You can use the [`tough-cookie`](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie) package:

```js
const got = require('got');
const {CookieJar} = require('tough-cookie');

const cookieJar = new CookieJar();
cookieJar.setCookie('foo=bar', 'https://www.google.com');

got('google.com', {cookieJar});
```


## Form data

You can use the [`form-data`](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) package to create POST request with form data:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const got = require('got');
const FormData = require('form-data');
const form = new FormData();

form.append('my_file', fs.createReadStream('/foo/bar.jpg'));

got.post('google.com', {
	body: form
});
```


## OAuth

You can use the [`oauth-1.0a`](https://github.com/ddo/oauth-1.0a) package to create a signed OAuth request:

```js
const got = require('got');
const crypto  = require('crypto');
const OAuth = require('oauth-1.0a');

const oauth = OAuth({
	consumer: {
		key: process.env.CONSUMER_KEY,
		secret: process.env.CONSUMER_SECRET
	},
	signature_method: 'HMAC-SHA1',
	hash_function: (baseString, key) => crypto.createHmac('sha1', key).update(baseString).digest('base64')
});

const token = {
	key: process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN,
	secret: process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
};

const url = 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/home_timeline.json';

got(url, {
	headers: oauth.toHeader(oauth.authorize({url, method: 'GET'}, token)),
	json: true
});
```


## Unix Domain Sockets

Requests can also be sent via [unix domain sockets](http://serverfault.com/questions/124517/whats-the-difference-between-unix-socket-and-tcp-ip-socket). Use the following URL scheme: `PROTOCOL://unix:SOCKET:PATH`.

- `PROTOCOL` - `http` or `https` *(optional)*
- `SOCKET` - Absolute path to a unix domain socket, for example: `/var/run/docker.sock`
- `PATH` - Request path, for example: `/v2/keys`

```js
got('http://unix:/var/run/docker.sock:/containers/json');

// Or without protocol (HTTP by default)
got('unix:/var/run/docker.sock:/containers/json');
```


## AWS

Requests to AWS services need to have their headers signed. This can be accomplished by using the [`aws4`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws4) package. This is an example for querying an ["API Gateway"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/signing-requests/) with a signed request.

```js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const aws4 = require('aws4');
const got = require('got');

const chain = new AWS.CredentialProviderChain();

// Create a Got instance to use relative paths and signed requests
const awsClient = got.extend({
	baseUrl: 'https://<api-id>.execute-api.<api-region>.amazonaws.com/<stage>/',
	hooks: {
		beforeRequest: [
			async options => {
				const credentials = await chain.resolvePromise();
				aws4.sign(options, credentials);
			}
		]
	}
});

const response = await awsClient('endpoint/path', {
	// Request-specific options
});
```


## Testing

You can test your requests by using the [`nock`](https://github.com/node-nock/nock) package to mock an endpoint:

```js
const got = require('got');
const nock = require('nock');

nock('https://sindresorhus.com')
	.get('/')
	.reply(200, 'Hello world!');

(async () => {
	const response = await got('sindresorhus.com');
	console.log(response.body);
	//=> 'Hello world!'
})();
```

If you need real integration tests you can use [`create-test-server`](https://github.com/lukechilds/create-test-server):

```js
const got = require('got');
const createTestServer = require('create-test-server');

(async () => {
	const server = await createTestServer();
	server.get('/', 'Hello world!');

	const response = await got(server.url);
	console.log(response.body);
	//=> 'Hello world!'

	await server.close();
})();
```


## Tips

### User Agent

It's a good idea to set the `'user-agent'` header so the provider can more easily see how their resource is used. By default, it's the URL to this repo. You can omit this header by setting it to `null`.

```js
const got = require('got');
const pkg = require('./package.json');

got('sindresorhus.com', {
	headers: {
		'user-agent': `my-package/${pkg.version} (https://github.com/username/my-package)`
	}
});

got('sindresorhus.com', {
	headers: {
		'user-agent': null
	}
});
```

### 304 Responses

Bear in mind; if you send an `if-modified-since` header and receive a `304 Not Modified` response, the body will be empty. It's your responsibility to cache and retrieve the body contents.

### Custom endpoints

Use `got.extend()` to make it nicer to work with REST APIs. Especially if you use the `baseUrl` option.

**Note:** Not to be confused with [`got.create()`](advanced-creation.md), which has no defaults.

```js
const got = require('got');
const pkg = require('./package.json');

const custom = got.extend({
	baseUrl: 'example.com',
	json: true,
	headers: {
		'user-agent': `my-package/${pkg.version} (https://github.com/username/my-package)`
	}
});

// Use `custom` exactly how you use `got`
(async () => {
	const list = await custom('/v1/users/list');
})();
```

**Tip:** Need to merge some instances into a single one? Check out [`got.mergeInstances()`](advanced-creation.md#merging-instances).

### Experimental HTTP2 support

Got provides an experimental support for HTTP2 using the [`http2-wrapper`](https://github.com/szmarczak/http2-wrapper) package:

```js
const got = require('got');
const {request} = require('http2-wrapper');

const h2got = got.extend({request});

(async () => {
	const {body} = await h2got('https://nghttp2.org/httpbin/headers');
	console.log(body);
})();
```

### [Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/graceful-fs/README.md](Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/graceful-fs/README.md)
# graceful-fs

graceful-fs functions as a drop-in replacement for the fs module,
making various improvements.

The improvements are meant to normalize behavior across different
platforms and environments, and to make filesystem access more
resilient to errors.

## Improvements over [fs module](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)

* Queues up `open` and `readdir` calls, and retries them once
  something closes if there is an EMFILE error from too many file
  descriptors.
* fixes `lchmod` for Node versions prior to 0.6.2.
* implements `fs.lutimes` if possible. Otherwise it becomes a noop.
* ignores `EINVAL` and `EPERM` errors in `chown`, `fchown` or
  `lchown` if the user isn't root.
* makes `lchmod` and `lchown` become noops, if not available.
* retries reading a file if `read` results in EAGAIN error.

On Windows, it retries renaming a file for up to one second if `EACCESS`
or `EPERM` error occurs, likely because antivirus software has locked
the directory.

## USAGE

```javascript
// use just like fs
var fs = require('graceful-fs')

// now go and do stuff with it...
fs.readFileSync('some-file-or-whatever')
```

## Global Patching

If you want to patch the global fs module (or any other fs-like
module) you can do this:

```javascript
// Make sure to read the caveat below.
var realFs = require('fs')
var gracefulFs = require('graceful-fs')
gracefulFs.gracefulify(realFs)
```

This should only ever be done at the top-level application layer, in
order to delay on EMFILE errors from any fs-using dependencies.  You
should **not** do this in a library, because it can cause unexpected
delays in other parts of the program.

## Changes

This module is fairly stable at this point, and used by a lot of
things.  That being said, because it implements a subtle behavior
change in a core part of the node API, even modest changes can be
extremely breaking, and the versioning is thus biased towards
bumping the major when in doubt.

The main change between major versions has been switching between
providing a fully-patched `fs` module vs monkey-patching the node core
builtin, and the approach by which a non-monkey-patched `fs` was
created.

The goal is to trade `EMFILE` errors for slower fs operations.  So, if
you try to open a zillion files, rather than crashing, `open`
operations will be queued up and wait for something else to `close`.

There are advantages to each approach.  Monkey-patching the fs means
that no `EMFILE` errors can possibly occur anywhere in your
application, because everything is using the same core `fs` module,
which is patched.  However, it can also obviously cause undesirable
side-effects, especially if the module is loaded multiple times.

Implementing a separate-but-identical patched `fs` module is more
surgical (and doesn't run the risk of patching multiple times), but
also imposes the challenge of keeping in sync with the core module.

The current approach loads the `fs` module, and then creates a
lookalike object that has all the same methods, except a few that are
patched.  It is safe to use in all versions of Node from 0.8 through
7.0.

### v4

* Do not monkey-patch the fs module.  This module may now be used as a
  drop-in dep, and users can opt into monkey-patching the fs builtin
  if their app requires it.

### v3

* Monkey-patch fs, because the eval approach no longer works on recent
  node.
* fixed possible type-error throw if rename fails on windows
* verify that we *never* get EMFILE errors
* Ignore ENOSYS from chmod/chown
* clarify that graceful-fs must be used as a drop-in

### v2.1.0

* Use eval rather than monkey-patching fs.
* readdir: Always sort the results
* win32: requeue a file if error has an OK status

### v2.0

* A return to monkey patching
* wrap process.cwd

### v1.1

* wrap readFile
* Wrap fs.writeFile.
* readdir protection
* Don't clobber the fs builtin
* Handle fs.read EAGAIN errors by trying again
* Expose the curOpen counter
* No-op lchown/lchmod if not implemented
* fs.rename patch only for win32
* Patch fs.rename to handle AV software on Windows
* Close #4 Chown should not fail on einval or eperm if non-root
* Fix isaacs/fstream#1 Only wrap fs one time
* Fix #3 Start at 1024 max files, then back off on EMFILE
* lutimes that doens't blow up on Linux
* A full on-rewrite using a queue instead of just swallowing the EMFILE error
* Wrap Read/Write streams as well

### 1.0

* Update engines for node 0.6
* Be lstat-graceful on Windows
* first

### [Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/http-cache-semantics/README.md](Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/http-cache-semantics/README.md)
# Can I cache this? [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kornelski/http-cache-semantics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kornelski/http-cache-semantics)

`CachePolicy` tells when responses can be reused from a cache, taking into account [HTTP RFC 7234](http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html) rules for user agents and shared caches.
It also implements [RFC 5861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5861), implementing `stale-if-error` and `stale-while-revalidate`.
It's aware of many tricky details such as the `Vary` header, proxy revalidation, and authenticated responses.

## Usage

Cacheability of an HTTP response depends on how it was requested, so both `request` and `response` are required to create the policy.

```js
const policy = new CachePolicy(request, response, options);

if (!policy.storable()) {
    // throw the response away, it's not usable at all
    return;
}

// Cache the data AND the policy object in your cache
// (this is pseudocode, roll your own cache (lru-cache package works))
letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.set(
    request.url,
    { policy, response },
    policy.timeToLive()
);
```

```js
// And later, when you receive a new request:
const { policy, response } = letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.get(newRequest.url);

// It's not enough that it exists in the cache, it has to match the new request, too:
if (policy && policy.satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)) {
    // OK, the previous response can be used to respond to the `newRequest`.
    // Response headers have to be updated, e.g. to add Age and remove uncacheable headers.
    response.headers = policy.responseHeaders();
    return response;
}
```

It may be surprising, but it's not enough for an HTTP response to be [fresh](#yo-fresh) to satisfy a request. It may need to match request headers specified in `Vary`. Even a matching fresh response may still not be usable if the new request restricted cacheability, etc.

The key method is `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)`, which checks whether the `newRequest` is compatible with the original request and whether all caching conditions are met.

### Constructor options

Request and response must have a `headers` property with all header names in lower case. `url`, `status` and `method` are optional (defaults are any URL, status `200`, and `GET` method).

```js
const request = {
    url: '/',
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        accept: '*/*',
    },
};

const response = {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
        'cache-control': 'public, max-age=7234',
    },
};

const options = {
    shared: true,
    cacheHeuristic: 0.1,
    immutableMinTimeToLive: 24 * 3600 * 1000, // 24h
    ignoreCargoCult: false,
};
```

If `options.shared` is `true` (default), then the response is evaluated from a perspective of a shared cache (i.e. `private` is not cacheable and `s-maxage` is respected). If `options.shared` is `false`, then the response is evaluated from a perspective of a single-user cache (i.e. `private` is cacheable and `s-maxage` is ignored). `shared: true` is recommended for HTTP clients.

`options.cacheHeuristic` is a fraction of response's age that is used as a fallback cache duration. The default is 0.1 (10%), e.g. if a file hasn't been modified for 100 days, it'll be cached for 100\*0.1 = 10 days.

`options.immutableMinTimeToLive` is a number of milliseconds to assume as the default time to cache responses with `Cache-Control: immutable`. Note that [per RFC](http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/immutable.html) these can become stale, so `max-age` still overrides the default.

If `options.ignoreCargoCult` is true, common anti-cache directives will be completely ignored if the non-standard `pre-check` and `post-check` directives are present. These two useless directives are most commonly found in bad StackOverflow answers and PHP's "session limiter" defaults.

### `storable()`

Returns `true` if the response can be stored in a cache. If it's `false` then you MUST NOT store either the request or the response.

### `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)`

This is the most important method. Use this method to check whether the cached response is still fresh in the context of the new request.

If it returns `true`, then the given `request` matches the original response this cache policy has been created with, and the response can be reused without contacting the server. Note that the old response can't be returned without being updated, see `responseHeaders()`.

If it returns `false`, then the response may not be matching at all (e.g. it's for a different URL or method), or may require to be refreshed first (see `revalidationHeaders()`).

### `responseHeaders()`

Returns updated, filtered set of response headers to return to clients receiving the cached response. This function is necessary, because proxies MUST always remove hop-by-hop headers (such as `TE` and `Connection`) and update response's `Age` to avoid doubling cache time.

```js
cachedResponse.headers = cachePolicy.responseHeaders(cachedResponse);
```

### `timeToLive()`

Returns approximate time in _milliseconds_ until the response becomes stale (i.e. not fresh).

After that time (when `timeToLive() <= 0`) the response might not be usable without revalidation. However, there are exceptions, e.g. a client can explicitly allow stale responses, so always check with `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation()`.
`stale-if-error` and `stale-while-revalidate` extend the time to live of the cache, that can still be used if stale.

### `toObject()`/`fromObject(json)`

Chances are you'll want to store the `CachePolicy` object along with the cached response. `obj = policy.toObject()` gives a plain JSON-serializable object. `policy = CachePolicy.fromObject(obj)` creates an instance from it.

### Refreshing stale cache (revalidation)

When a cached response has expired, it can be made fresh again by making a request to the origin server. The server may respond with status 304 (Not Modified) without sending the response body again, saving bandwidth.

The following methods help perform the update efficiently and correctly.

#### `revalidationHeaders(newRequest)`

Returns updated, filtered set of request headers to send to the origin server to check if the cached response can be reused. These headers allow the origin server to return status 304 indicating the response is still fresh. All headers unrelated to caching are passed through as-is.

Use this method when updating cache from the origin server.

```js
updateRequest.headers = cachePolicy.revalidationHeaders(updateRequest);
```

#### `revalidatedPolicy(revalidationRequest, revalidationResponse)`

Use this method to update the cache after receiving a new response from the origin server. It returns an object with two keys:

-   `policy` — A new `CachePolicy` with HTTP headers updated from `revalidationResponse`. You can always replace the old cached `CachePolicy` with the new one.
-   `modified` — Boolean indicating whether the response body has changed.
    -   If `false`, then a valid 304 Not Modified response has been received, and you can reuse the old cached response body. This is also affected by `stale-if-error`.
    -   If `true`, you should use new response's body (if present), or make another request to the origin server without any conditional headers (i.e. don't use `revalidationHeaders()` this time) to get the new resource.

```js
// When serving requests from cache:
const { oldPolicy, oldResponse } = letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.get(
    newRequest.url
);

if (!oldPolicy.satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)) {
    // Change the request to ask the origin server if the cached response can be used
    newRequest.headers = oldPolicy.revalidationHeaders(newRequest);

    // Send request to the origin server. The server may respond with status 304
    const newResponse = await makeRequest(newRequest);

    // Create updated policy and combined response from the old and new data
    const { policy, modified } = oldPolicy.revalidatedPolicy(
        newRequest,
        newResponse
    );
    const response = modified ? newResponse : oldResponse;

    // Update the cache with the newer/fresher response
    letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.set(
        newRequest.url,
        { policy, response },
        policy.timeToLive()
    );

    // And proceed returning cached response as usual
    response.headers = policy.responseHeaders();
    return response;
}
```

## Used by

-   [ImageOptim API](https://imageoptim.com/api), [make-fetch-happen](https://github.com/zkat/make-fetch-happen), [cacheable-request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cacheable-request) ([got](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got)), [npm/registry-fetch](https://github.com/npm/registry-fetch), [etc.](https://github.com/kornelski/http-cache-semantics/network/dependents)

## Implemented

-   `Cache-Control` response header with all the quirks.
-   `Expires` with check for bad clocks.
-   `Pragma` response header.
-   `Age` response header.
-   `Vary` response header.
-   Default cacheability of statuses and methods.
-   Requests for stale data.
-   Filtering of hop-by-hop headers.
-   Basic revalidation request
-   `stale-if-error`

## Unimplemented

-   Merging of range requests, `If-Range` (but correctly supports them as non-cacheable)
-   Revalidation of multiple representations

### Trusting server `Date`

Per the RFC, the cache should take into account the time between server-supplied `Date` and the time it received the response. The RFC-mandated behavior creates two problems:

 * Servers with incorrectly set timezone may add several hours to cache age (or more, if the clock is completely wrong).
 * Even reasonably correct clocks may be off by a couple of seconds, breaking `max-age=1` trick (which is useful for reverse proxies on high-traffic servers).

Previous versions of this library had an option to ignore the server date if it was "too inaccurate". To support the `max-age=1` trick the library also has to ignore dates that pretty accurate. There's no point of having an option to trust dates that are only a bit inaccurate, so this library won't trust any server dates. `max-age` will be interpreted from the time the response has been received, not from when it has been sent. This will affect only [RFC 1149 networks](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149).

### [Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/inherits/README.md](Github/bgoonz-master/bgoonz-master/node_modules/inherits/README.md)
Browser-friendly inheritance fully compatible with standard node.js
[inherits](http://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inherits_constructor_superconstructor).

This package exports standard `inherits` from node.js `util` module in
node environment, but also provides alternative browser-friendly
implementation through [browser
field](https://gist.github.com/shtylman/4339901). Alternative
implementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone
module to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old
browsers with no `Object.create` support.

While keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`
implementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as
[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not
include full `util` package to your client code if all you need is
just `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`
package is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need
from it.

It's recommended to use this package instead of
`require('util').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used
not only in node.js but in browser too.

## usage

```js
var inherits = require('inherits');
// then use exactly as the standard one
```

## note on version ~1.0

Version ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible
neither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.

If you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be
careful:

* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing
  superclass
* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any
  existing fields on it

> Returns `true` if the given string looks like a glob pattern or an extglob pattern. This makes it easy to create code that only uses external modules like node-glob when necessary, resulting in much faster code execution and initialization time, and a better user experience.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save is-glob
```

You might also be interested in [is-valid-glob](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/is-valid-glob) and [has-glob](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/has-glob).

## Usage

```js
var isGlob = require('is-glob');
```

### Default behavior

**True**

Patterns that have glob characters or regex patterns will return `true`:

```js
isGlob('!foo.js');
isGlob('*.js');
isGlob('**/abc.js');
isGlob('abc/*.js');
isGlob('abc/(aaa|bbb).js');
isGlob('abc/[a-z].js');
isGlob('abc/{a,b}.js');
//=> true
```

Extglobs

```js
isGlob('abc/@(a).js');
isGlob('abc/!(a).js');
isGlob('abc/+(a).js');
isGlob('abc/*(a).js');
isGlob('abc/?(a).js');
//=> true
```

**False**

Escaped globs or extglobs return `false`:

```js
isGlob('abc/\\@(a).js');
isGlob('abc/\\!(a).js');
isGlob('abc/\\+(a).js');
isGlob('abc/\\*(a).js');
isGlob('abc/\\?(a).js');
isGlob('\\!foo.js');
isGlob('\\*.js');
isGlob('\\*\\*/abc.js');
isGlob('abc/\\*.js');
isGlob('abc/\\(aaa|bbb).js');
isGlob('abc/\\[a-z].js');
isGlob('abc/\\{a,b}.js');
//=> false
```

Patterns that do not have glob patterns return `false`:

```js
isGlob('abc.js');
isGlob('abc/def/ghi.js');
isGlob('foo.js');
isGlob('abc/@.js');
isGlob('abc/+.js');
isGlob('abc/?.js');
isGlob();
isGlob(null);
//=> false
```

Arrays are also `false` (If you want to check if an array has a glob pattern, use [has-glob](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/has-glob)):

```js
isGlob(['**/*.js']);
isGlob(['foo.js']);
//=> false
```

### Option strict

When `options.strict === false` the behavior is less strict in determining if a pattern is a glob. Meaning that
some patterns that would return `false` may return `true`. This is done so that matching libraries like [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) have a chance at determining if the pattern is a glob or not.

**True**

Patterns that have glob characters or regex patterns will return `true`:

```js
isGlob('!foo.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('*.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('**/abc.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/*.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/(aaa|bbb).js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/[a-z].js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/{a,b}.js', {strict: false});
//=> true
```

Extglobs

```js
isGlob('abc/@(a).js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/!(a).js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/+(a).js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/*(a).js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/?(a).js', {strict: false});
//=> true
```

**False**

Escaped globs or extglobs return `false`:

```js
isGlob('\\!foo.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('\\*.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('\\*\\*/abc.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/\\*.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/\\(aaa|bbb).js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/\\[a-z].js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/\\{a,b}.js', {strict: false});
//=> false
```

> Returns true if the value is a finite number.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save is-number
```

## Why is this needed?

In JavaScript, it's not always as straightforward as it should be to reliably check if a value is a number. It's common for devs to use `+`, `-`, or `Number()` to cast a string value to a number (for example, when values are returned from user input, regex matches, parsers, etc). But there are many non-intuitive edge cases that yield unexpected results:

```js
console.log(+[]); //=> 0
console.log(+''); //=> 0
console.log(+'   '); //=> 0
console.log(typeof NaN); //=> 'number'
```

This library offers a performant way to smooth out edge cases like these.

## Usage

```js
const isNumber = require('is-number');
```

See the [tests](./test.js) for more examples.

### true

```js
isNumber(5e3);               // true
isNumber(0xff);              // true
isNumber(-1.1);              // true
isNumber(0);                 // true
isNumber(1);                 // true
isNumber(1.1);               // true
isNumber(10);                // true
isNumber(10.10);             // true
isNumber(100);               // true
isNumber('-1.1');            // true
isNumber('0');               // true
isNumber('012');             // true
isNumber('0xff');            // true
isNumber('1');               // true
isNumber('1.1');             // true
isNumber('10');              // true
isNumber('10.10');           // true
isNumber('100');             // true
isNumber('5e3');             // true
isNumber(parseInt('012'));   // true
isNumber(parseFloat('012')); // true
```

### False

Everything else is false, as you would expect:

```js
isNumber(Infinity);          // false
isNumber(NaN);               // false
isNumber(null);              // false
isNumber(undefined);         // false
isNumber('');                // false
isNumber('   ');             // false
isNumber('foo');             // false
isNumber([1]);               // false
isNumber([]);                // false
isNumber(function () {});    // false
isNumber({});                // false
```

## Release history

### 7.0.0

* Refactor. Now uses `.isFinite` if it exists.
* Performance is about the same as v6.0 when the value is a string or number. But it's now 3x-4x faster when the value is not a string or number.

### 6.0.0

* Optimizations, thanks to @benaadams.

### 5.0.0

**Breaking changes**

* removed support for `instanceof Number` and `instanceof String`

# json-buffer

JSON functions that can convert buffers!

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dominictarr/json-buffer.png)](http://travis-ci.org/dominictarr/json-buffer)

[![testling badge](https://ci.testling.com/dominictarr/json-buffer.png)](https://ci.testling.com/dominictarr/json-buffer)

JSON mangles buffers by converting to an array...
which isn't helpful. json-buffers converts to base64 instead,
and deconverts base64 to a buffer.

``` js
var JSONB = require('json-buffer')
var Buffer = require('buffer').Buffer

var str = JSONB.stringify(new Buffer('hello there!'))

console.log(JSONB.parse(str)) //GET a BUFFER back
```

Node.js - jsonfile
================

Easily read/write JSON files in Node.js. _Note: this module cannot be used in the browser._

[![npm Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/jsonfile.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jsonfile)
[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jprichardson/node-jsonfile.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/jprichardson/node-jsonfile)
[![windows Build status](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/jprichardson/node-jsonfile/master.svg?label=windows%20build)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jprichardson/node-jsonfile/branch/master)

<a href="https://github.com/feross/standard"><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/sticker.svg" alt="Standard JavaScript" width="100"></a>

Why?
----

Writing `JSON.stringify()` and then `fs.writeFile()` and `JSON.parse()` with `fs.readFile()` enclosed in `try/catch` blocks became annoying.



Installation
------------

    npm install --save jsonfile



API
---

* [`readFile(filename, [options], callback)`](#readfilefilename-options-callback)
* [`readFileSync(filename, [options])`](#readfilesyncfilename-options)
* [`writeFile(filename, obj, [options], callback)`](#writefilefilename-obj-options-callback)
* [`writeFileSync(filename, obj, [options])`](#writefilesyncfilename-obj-options)

----

### readFile(filename, [options], callback)

`options` (`object`, default `undefined`): Pass in any [`fs.readFile`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_path_options_callback) options or set `reviver` for a [JSON reviver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).
  - `throws` (`boolean`, default: `true`). If `JSON.parse` throws an error, pass this error to the callback.
  If `false`, returns `null` for the object.


```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')
const file = '/tmp/data.json'
jsonfile.readFile(file, function (err, obj) {
  if (err) console.error(err)
  console.dir(obj)
})
```

You can also use this method with promises. The `readFile` method will return a promise if you do not pass a callback function.

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')
const file = '/tmp/data.json'
jsonfile.readFile(file)
  .then(obj => console.dir(obj))
  .catch(error => console.error(error))
```

----

### readFileSync(filename, [options])

`options` (`object`, default `undefined`): Pass in any [`fs.readFileSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfilesync_path_options) options or set `reviver` for a [JSON reviver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).
- `throws` (`boolean`, default: `true`). If an error is encountered reading or parsing the file, throw the error. If `false`, returns `null` for the object.

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')
const file = '/tmp/data.json'

console.dir(jsonfile.readFileSync(file))
```

----

### writeFile(filename, obj, [options], callback)

`options`: Pass in any [`fs.writeFile`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefile_file_data_options_callback) options or set `replacer` for a [JSON replacer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify). Can also pass in `spaces`, or override `EOL` string or set `finalEOL` flag as `false` to not save the file with `EOL` at the end.


```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFile(file, obj, function (err) {
  if (err) console.error(err)
})
```
Or use with promises as follows:

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFile(file, obj)
  .then(res => {
    console.log('Write complete')
  })
  .catch(error => console.error(error))
```


**formatting with spaces:**

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFile(file, obj, { spaces: 2 }, function (err) {
  if (err) console.error(err)
})
```

**overriding EOL:**

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFile(file, obj, { spaces: 2, EOL: '\r\n' }, function (err) {
  if (err) console.error(err)
})
```


**disabling the EOL at the end of file:**

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFile(file, obj, { spaces: 2, finalEOL: false }, function (err) {
  if (err) console.log(err)
})
```

**appending to an existing JSON file:**

You can use `fs.writeFile` option `{ flag: 'a' }` to achieve this.

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/mayAlreadyExistedData.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFile(file, obj, { flag: 'a' }, function (err) {
  if (err) console.error(err)
})
```

----

### writeFileSync(filename, obj, [options])

`options`: Pass in any [`fs.writeFileSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefilesync_file_data_options) options or set `replacer` for a [JSON replacer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify). Can also pass in `spaces`, or override `EOL` string or set `finalEOL` flag as `false` to not save the file with `EOL` at the end.

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFileSync(file, obj)
```

**formatting with spaces:**

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFileSync(file, obj, { spaces: 2 })
```

**overriding EOL:**

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFileSync(file, obj, { spaces: 2, EOL: '\r\n' })
```

**disabling the EOL at the end of file:**

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/data.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFileSync(file, obj, { spaces: 2, finalEOL: false })
```

**appending to an existing JSON file:**

You can use `fs.writeFileSync` option `{ flag: 'a' }` to achieve this.

```js
const jsonfile = require('jsonfile')

const file = '/tmp/mayAlreadyExistedData.json'
const obj = { name: 'JP' }

jsonfile.writeFileSync(file, obj, { flag: 'a' })
```

> Simple key-value storage with support for multiple backends

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/keyv/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/keyv?branch=master)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/keyv.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/keyv.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv)

Keyv provides a consistent interface for key-value storage across multiple backends via storage adapters. It supports TTL based expiry, making it suitable as a cache or a persistent key-value store.

## Features

There are a few existing modules similar to Keyv, however Keyv is different because it:

- Isn't bloated
- Has a simple Promise based API
- Suitable as a TTL based cache or persistent key-value store
- [Easily embeddable](#add-cache-support-to-your-module) inside another module
- Works with any storage that implements the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) API
- Handles all JSON types plus `Buffer`
- Supports namespaces
- Wide range of [**efficient, well tested**](#official-storage-adapters) storage adapters
- Connection errors are passed through (db failures won't kill your app)
- Supports the current active LTS version of Node.js or higher

## Usage

Install Keyv.

```
npm install --save keyv
```

By default everything is stored in memory, you can optionally also install a storage adapter.

```
npm install --save @keyv/redis
npm install --save @keyv/mongo
npm install --save @keyv/sqlite
npm install --save @keyv/postgres
npm install --save @keyv/mysql
```

Create a new Keyv instance, passing your connection string if applicable. Keyv will automatically load the correct storage adapter.

```js
const Keyv = require('keyv');

// One of the following
const keyv = new Keyv();
const keyv = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379');
const keyv = new Keyv('mongodb://user:pass@localhost:27017/dbname');
const keyv = new Keyv('sqlite://path/to/database.sqlite');
const keyv = new Keyv('postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname');
const keyv = new Keyv('mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/dbname');

// Handle DB connection errors
keyv.on('error', err => console.log('Connection Error', err));

await keyv.set('foo', 'expires in 1 second', 1000); // true
await keyv.set('foo', 'never expires'); // true
await keyv.get('foo'); // 'never expires'
await keyv.delete('foo'); // true
await keyv.clear(); // undefined
```

### Namespaces

You can namespace your Keyv instance to avoid key collisions and allow you to clear only a certain namespace while using the same database.

```js
const users = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'users' });
const cache = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'cache' });

await users.set('foo', 'users'); // true
await cache.set('foo', 'cache'); // true
await users.get('foo'); // 'users'
await cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'
await users.clear(); // undefined
await users.get('foo'); // undefined
await cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'
```

### Custom Serializers

Keyv uses [`json-buffer`](https://github.com/dominictarr/json-buffer) for data serialization to ensure consistency across different backends.

You can optionally provide your own serialization functions to support extra data types or to serialize to something other than JSON.

```js
const keyv = new Keyv({ serialize: JSON.stringify, deserialize: JSON.parse });
```

**Warning:** Using custom serializers means you lose any guarantee of data consistency. You should do extensive testing with your serialisation functions and chosen storage engine.

## Official Storage Adapters

The official storage adapters are covered by [over 150 integration tests](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv/jobs/260418145) to guarantee consistent behaviour. They are lightweight, efficient wrappers over the DB clients making use of indexes and native TTLs where available.

Database | Adapter | Native TTL | Status
---|---|---|---
Redis | [@keyv/redis](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv-redis) | Yes | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-redis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-redis) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/keyv-redis/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/keyv-redis?branch=master)
MongoDB | [@keyv/mongo](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv-mongo) | Yes | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-mongo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-mongo) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/keyv-mongo/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/keyv-mongo?branch=master)
SQLite | [@keyv/sqlite](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv-sqlite) | No | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-sqlite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-sqlite) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/keyv-sqlite/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/keyv-sqlite?branch=master)
PostgreSQL | [@keyv/postgres](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv-postgres) | No | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-postgres.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechildskeyv-postgreskeyv) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/keyv-postgres/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/keyv-postgres?branch=master)
MySQL | [@keyv/mysql](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv-mysql) | No | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-mysql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukechilds/keyv-mysql) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukechilds/keyv-mysql/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukechilds/keyv-mysql?branch=master)

## Third-party Storage Adapters

You can also use third-party storage adapters or build your own. Keyv will wrap these storage adapters in TTL functionality and handle complex types internally.

```js
const Keyv = require('keyv');
const myAdapter = require('./my-storage-adapter');

const keyv = new Keyv({ store: myAdapter });
```

Any store that follows the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) api will work.

```js
new Keyv({ store: new Map() });
```

For example, [`quick-lru`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) is a completely unrelated module that implements the Map API.

```js
const Keyv = require('keyv');
const QuickLRU = require('quick-lru');

const lru = new QuickLRU({ maxSize: 1000 });
const keyv = new Keyv({ store: lru });
```

The following are third-party storage adapters compatible with Keyv:

- [quick-lru](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) - Simple "Least Recently Used" (LRU) cache
- [keyv-file](https://github.com/zaaack/keyv-file) - File system storage adapter for Keyv
- [keyv-dynamodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-dynamodb) - DynamoDB storage adapter for Keyv

## Add Cache Support to your Module

Keyv is designed to be easily embedded into other modules to add cache support. The recommended pattern is to expose a `cache` option in your modules options which is passed through to Keyv. Caching will work in memory by default and users have the option to also install a Keyv storage adapter and pass in a connection string, or any other storage that implements the `Map` API.

You should also set a namespace for your module so you can safely call `.clear()` without clearing unrelated app data.

Inside your module:

```js
class AwesomeModule {
	constructor(opts) {
		this.cache = new Keyv({
			uri: typeof opts.cache === 'string' && opts.cache,
			store: typeof opts.cache !== 'string' && opts.cache,
			namespace: 'awesome-module'
		});
	}
}
```

Now it can be consumed like this:

```js
const AwesomeModule = require('awesome-module');

// Caches stuff in memory by default
const awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule();

// After npm install --save keyv-redis
const awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: 'redis://localhost' });

// Some third-party module that implements the Map API
const awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: some3rdPartyStore });
```

## API

### new Keyv([uri], [options])

Returns a new Keyv instance.

The Keyv instance is also an `EventEmitter` that will emit an `'error'` event if the storage adapter connection fails.

### uri

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `undefined`

The connection string URI.

Merged into the options object as options.uri.

### options

Type: `Object`

The options object is also passed through to the storage adapter. Check your storage adapter docs for any extra options.

#### options.namespace

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `'keyv'`

Namespace for the current instance.

#### options.ttl

Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Default TTL. Can be overridden by specififying a TTL on `.set()`.

#### options.serialize

Type: `Function`<br>
Default: `JSONB.stringify`

A custom serialization function.

#### options.deserialize

Type: `Function`<br>
Default: `JSONB.parse`

A custom deserialization function.

#### options.store

Type: `Storage adapter instance`<br>
Default: `new Map()`

The storage adapter instance to be used by Keyv.

#### options.adapter

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Specify an adapter to use. e.g `'redis'` or `'mongodb'`.

### Instance

Keys must always be strings. Values can be of any type.

#### .set(key, value, [ttl])

Set a value.

By default keys are persistent. You can set an expiry TTL in milliseconds.

Returns `true`.

#### .get(key)

Returns the value.

#### .delete(key)

Deletes an entry.

Returns `true` if the key existed, `false` if not.

#### .clear()

Delete all entries in the current namespace.

Returns `undefined`.

## ➤ Weekly-Quick-Snips:
---
#### Snippet of the Day:


### replaceAll 
the method string.replaceAll(search, replaceWith) replaces all appearances of search string with replaceWith.
```javascript


const str = 'this is a JSsnippets example';

const updatedStr = str.replace('example', 'snippet'); // 'this is a  JSsnippets snippet'


The tricky part is that replace method replaces only the very first match of the substring we have passed:


const str = 'this is a JSsnippets example and examples are great';

const updatedStr = str.replace('example', 'snippet'); //'this is a JSsnippets snippet and examples are great'

In order to go through this, we need to use a global regexp instead:


const str = 'this is a JSsnippets example and examples are great';

const updatedStr = str.replace(/example/g, 'snippet'); //'this is a JSsnippets snippet and snippets are greatr'

but now we have new friend in town, replaceAll

const str = 'this is a JSsnippets example and examples are great';

const updatedStr = str.replaceAll('example', 'snippet'); //'this is a JSsnippets snippet and snippets are greatr'

```

### Fibonacci in Python:

```py
def fib_iter(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    p0 = 0
    p1 = 1
    for i in range(n-1):
        next_val = p0 + p1
        p0 = p1
        p1 = next_val
    return next_val
for i in range(10):
    print(f'{i}: {fib_iter(i)}')
```

 #### Yesterday's Snippet of the day:

---

```py
def quicksort(l):
    # One of our base cases is an empty list or list with one element
    if len(l) == 0 or len(l) == 1:
        return l
    # If we have a left list, a pivot point and a right list...
    # assigns the return values of the partition() function
    left, pivot, right = partition(l) 
    # Our sorted list looks like left + pivot + right, but sorted.
    # Pivot has to be in brackets to be a list, so python can concatenate all the elements to a single list
    return quicksort(left) + [pivot] + quicksort(right)



print(quicksort([]))



print(quicksort([1]))



print(quicksort([1,2]))

print(quicksort([2,1]))


print(quicksort([2,2]))


print(quicksort([5,3,9,4,8,1,7]))


print(quicksort([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]))


print(quicksort([9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]))

# <a id="asymptotic-notation"></a>Asymptotic Notation
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition:
Asymptotic Notation is the hardware independent notation used to tell the time and space complexity of an algorithm. Meaning it's a standardized way of measuring how much memory an algorithm uses or how long it runs for given an input.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Complexities
The following are the Asymptotic rates of growth from best to worst:
- constant growth - ``O(1)`` Runtime is constant and does not grow with `n`
- logarithmic growth – ``O(log n)`` Runtime grows logarithmically in proportion to `n`
- linear growth – ``O(n)`` Runtime grows directly in proportion to `n`
- superlinear growth – ``O(n log n)`` Runtime grows in proportion _and_ logarithmically to `n`
- polynomial growth – `O(n^c)` Runtime grows quicker than previous all based on `n`
- exponential growth – `O(c^n)` Runtime grows even faster than polynomial growth based on `n`
- factorial growth – `O(n!)` Runtime grows the fastest and becomes quickly unusable for even
small values of `n`

[(source: Wikipedia, _Computational Complexity of Mathematical Operations_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_mathematical_operations)
###   <span style="color:red;"> Big-O notation
Big-O refers to the upper bound of time or space complexity of an algorithm, meaning it worst case runtime scenario. An easy way to think of it is that runtime could be better than Big-O but it will never be worse.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Big-Ω (Big-Omega) notation
Big-Omega refers to the lower bound of time or space complexity of an algorithm, meaning it is the best runtime scenario. Or runtime could worse than Big-Omega, but it will never be better.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Big-θ (Big-Theta) notation
Big-Theta refers to the tight bound of time or space complexity of an algorithm. Another way to think of it is the intersection of Big-O and Big-Omega, or more simply runtime is guaranteed to be a given complexity, such as `n log n`.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Big-O and Big-Theta are the most common and helpful notations
- Big-O does _not_ mean Worst Case Scenario, Big-Theta does _not_ mean average case, and Big-Omega does _not_ mean Best Case Scenario. They only connote the algorithm's performance for a particular scenario, and all three can be used for any scenario.
- Worst Case means given an unideal input, Average Case means given a typical input, Best case means a ideal input. Ex. Worst case means given an input the algorithm performs particularly bad, or best case an already sorted array for a sorting algorithm.
- Best Case and Big Omega are generally not helpful since Best Cases are rare in the real world and lower bound might be very different than an upper bound.
- Big-O isn't everything. On paper merge sort is faster than quick sort, but in practice quick sort is superior.
# <a id="data-structures"></a>Data Structures
###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="array"></a> Array
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- Stores data elements based on an sequential, most commonly 0 based, index.
- Based on [tuples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple) from set theory.
- They are one of the oldest, most commonly used data structures.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Optimal for indexing; bad at searching, inserting, and deleting (except at the end).
- **Linear arrays**, or one dimensional arrays, are the most basic.
  - Are static in size, meaning that they are declared with a fixed size.
- **Dynamic arrays** are like one dimensional arrays, but have reserved space for additional elements.
  - If a dynamic array is full, it copies its contents to a larger array.
- **Multi dimensional arrays** nested arrays that allow for multiple dimensions such as an array of arrays providing a 2 dimensional spacial representation via x, y coordinates.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Time Complexity
- Indexing:         Linear array: `O(1)`,      Dynamic array: `O(1)`
- Search:           Linear array: `O(n)`,      Dynamic array: `O(n)`
- Optimized Search: Linear array: `O(log n)`,  Dynamic array: `O(log n)`
- Insertion:        Linear array: n/a,         Dynamic array: `O(n)`
###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="linked-list"></a> Linked List
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- Stores data with **nodes** that point to other nodes.
  - Nodes, at its most basic it has one datum and one reference (another node).
  - A linked list _chains_ nodes together by pointing one node's reference towards another node.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Designed to optimize insertion and deletion, slow at indexing and searching.
- **Doubly linked list** has nodes that also reference the previous node.
- **Circularly linked list** is simple linked list whose **tail**, the last node, references the **head**, the first node.
- **Stack**, commonly implemented with linked lists but can be made from arrays too.
  - Stacks are **last in, first out** (LIFO) data structures.
  - Made with a linked list by having the head be the only place for insertion and removal.
- **Queues**, too can be implemented with a linked list or an array.
  - Queues are a **first in, first out** (FIFO) data structure.
  - Made with a doubly linked list that only removes from head and adds to tail.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Time Complexity
- Indexing:         Linked Lists: `O(n)`
- Search:           Linked Lists: `O(n)`
- Optimized Search: Linked Lists: `O(n)`
- Append:           Linked Lists: `O(1)`
- Prepend:          Linked Lists: `O(1)`
- Insertion:        Linked Lists: `O(n)`
###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="hash"></a> Hash Table or Hash Map
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- Stores data with key value pairs.
- **Hash functions** accept a key and return an output unique only to that specific key.
  - This is known as **hashing**, which is the concept that an input and an output have a one-to-one correspondence to map information.
  - Hash functions return a unique address in memory for that data.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Designed to optimize searching, insertion, and deletion.
- **Hash collisions** are when a hash function returns the same output for two distinct inputs.
  - All hash functions have this problem.
  - This is often accommodated for by having the hash tables be very large.
- Hashes are important for associative arrays and database indexing.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Time Complexity
- Indexing:         Hash Tables: `O(1)`
- Search:           Hash Tables: `O(1)`
- Insertion:        Hash Tables: `O(1)`
###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="binary-tree"></a> Binary Tree
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- Is a tree like data structure where every node has at most two children.
  - There is one left and right child node.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Designed to optimize searching and sorting.
- A **degenerate tree** is an unbalanced tree, which if entirely one-sided, is essentially a linked list.
- They are comparably simple to implement than other data structures.
- Used to make **binary search trees**.
  - A binary tree that uses comparable keys to assign which direction a child is.
  - Left child has a key smaller than its parent node.
  - Right child has a key greater than its parent node.
  - There can be no duplicate node.
  - Because of the above it is more likely to be used as a data structure than a binary tree.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Time Complexity
- Indexing:  Binary Search Tree: `O(log n)`
- Search:    Binary Search Tree: `O(log n)`
- Insertion: Binary Search Tree: `O(log n)`
# <a id="algorithms"></a> Algorithms
## <a id="algorithm-basics"></a> Algorithm Basics
###   <span style="color:red;"> Recursive Algorithms
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- An algorithm that calls itself in its definition.
  - **Recursive case** a conditional statement that is used to trigger the recursion.
  - **Base case** a conditional statement that is used to break the recursion.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- **Stack level too deep** and **stack overflow**.
  - If you've seen either of these from a recursive algorithm, you messed up.
  - It means that your base case was never triggered because it was faulty or the problem was so massive you ran out of alloted memory.
  - Knowing whether or not you will reach a base case is integral to correctly using recursion.
  - Often used in Depth First Search
###   <span style="color:red;"> Iterative Algorithms
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- An algorithm that is called repeatedly but for a finite number of times, each time being a single iteration.
  - Often used to move incrementally through a data set.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Generally you will see iteration as loops, for, while, and until statements.
- Think of iteration as moving one at a time through a set.
- Often used to move through an array.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Recursion Vs. Iteration
- The differences between recursion and iteration can be confusing to distinguish since both can be used to implement the other. But know that,
  - Recursion is, usually, more expressive and easier to implement.
  - Iteration uses less memory.
- **Functional languages** tend to use recursion. (i.e. Haskell)
- **Imperative languages** tend to use iteration. (i.e. Ruby)
- Check out this [Stack Overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19794739/what-is-the-difference-between-iteration-and-recursion) for more info.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Greedy Algorithms
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- An algorithm that, while executing, selects only the information that meets a certain criteria.
- The general five components, taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm#Specifics):
  - A candidate set, from which a solution is created.
  - A selection function, which chooses the best candidate to be added to the solution.
  - A feasibility function, that is used to determine if a candidate can be used to contribute to a solution.
  - An objective function, which assigns a value to a solution, or a partial solution.
  - A solution function, which will indicate when we have discovered a complete solution.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Used to find the expedient, though non-optimal, solution for a given problem.
- Generally used on sets of data where only a small proportion of the information evaluated meets the desired result.
- Often a greedy algorithm can help reduce the Big O of an algorithm.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Pseudo Code of a Greedy Algorithm to Find Largest Difference of any Two Numbers in an Array.
```
greedy algorithm (array)
  let largest difference = 0
  let new difference = find next difference (array[n], array[n+1])
  largest difference = new difference if new difference is > largest difference
  repeat above two steps until all differences have been found
  return largest difference
```
This algorithm never needed to compare all the differences to one another, saving it an entire iteration.
## <a id="search-algorithms"></a>Search Algorithms
###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="breadth-first-search"></a>Breadth First Search
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- An algorithm that searches a tree (or graph) by searching levels of the tree first, starting at the root.
  - It finds every node on the same level, most often moving left to right.
  - While doing this it tracks the children nodes of the nodes on the current level.
  - When finished examining a level it moves to the left most node on the next level.
  - The bottom-right most node is evaluated last (the node that is deepest and is farthest right of it's level).
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Optimal for searching a tree that is wider than it is deep.
- Uses a queue to store information about the tree while it traverses a tree.
  - Because it uses a queue it is more memory intensive than **depth first search**.
  - The queue uses more memory because it needs to stores pointers
###   <span style="color:red;"> Time Complexity
- Search: Breadth First Search: O(V + E)
- E is number of edges
- V is number of vertices
###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="depth-first-search"></a>Depth First Search
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- An algorithm that searches a tree (or graph) by searching depth of the tree first, starting at the root.
  - It traverses left down a tree until it cannot go further.
  - Once it reaches the end of a branch it traverses back up trying the right child of nodes on that branch, and if possible left from the right children.
  - When finished examining a branch it moves to the node right of the root then tries to go left on all it's children until it reaches the bottom.
  - The right most node is evaluated last (the node that is right of all it's ancestors).
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Optimal for searching a tree that is deeper than it is wide.
- Uses a stack to push nodes onto.
  - Because a stack is LIFO it does not need to keep track of the nodes pointers and is therefore less memory intensive than breadth first search.
  - Once it cannot go further left it begins evaluating the stack.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Time Complexity
- Search: Depth First Search: O(|E| + |V|)
- E is number of edges
- V is number of vertices
###   <span style="color:red;"> Breadth First Search Vs. Depth First Search
- The simple answer to this question is that it depends on the size and shape of the tree.
  - For wide, shallow trees use Breadth First Search
  - For deep, narrow trees use Depth First Search
###   <span style="color:red;"> Nuances
  - Because BFS uses queues to store information about the nodes and its children, it could use more memory than is available on your computer. (But you probably won't have to worry about this.)
  - If using a DFS on a tree that is very deep you might go unnecessarily deep in the search. See [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/761/) for more information.
  - Breadth First Search tends to be a looping algorithm.
  - Depth First Search tends to be a recursive algorithm.

###   <span style="color:red;"> <a id="selection-sort"></a>Selection Sort
###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- A comparison based sorting algorithm.
  - Starts with the cursor on the left, iterating left to right
  - Compares the left side to the right, looking for the smallest known item
    - If the left is smaller than the item to the right it continues iterating
    - If the left is bigger than the item to the right, the item on the right becomes the known smallest number
    - Once it has checked all items, it moves the known smallest to the cursor and advances the cursor to the right and starts over
  - As the algorithm processes the data set, it builds a fully sorted left side of the data until the entire data set is sorted
- Changes the array in place.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Inefficient for large data sets.
- Very simple to implement.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Time Complexity

###   <span style="color:red;"> Definition
- A comparison based sorting algorithm.
  - Iterates left to right comparing the current cursor to the previous item.
  - If the cursor is smaller than the item on the left it swaps positions and the cursor compares itself again to the left hand side until it is put in its sorted position.
  - As the algorithm processes the data set, the left side becomes increasingly sorted until it is fully sorted.
- Changes the array in place.
###   <span style="color:red;"> What you need to know
- Inefficient for large data sets, but can be faster for than other algorithms for small ones.
- Although it has an `O(n^2)`, in practice it slightly less since its comparison scheme only requires checking place if its smaller than its neighbor.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is ARIA and when should you use it?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
ARIA stands for "Accessible Rich Internet Applications", and is a technical specification created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Better known as WAI-ARIA, it provides additional HTML attributes in the development of web applications to offer people who use assistive technologies (AT) a more robust and interoperable experience with dynamic components. By providing the component's role, name, and state, AT users can better understand how to interact with the component. WAI-ARIA should only be used when an HTML element equivalent is not available or lacks full browser or AT support. WAI-ARIA's semantic markup coupled with JavaScript works to provide an understandable and interactive experience for people who use AT.
An example using ARIA:
    <div 
      role="combobox"
      aria-expanded="false"
      aria-owns="ex1-grid"
      aria-haspopup="grid"
      id="ex1-combobox">
      ...
    </div>

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the minimum recommended ratio of contrast between foreground text and background to comply with WCAG? Why does this matter?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
4.5:1 is the calculated contrast ratio between foreground text and background that is recommended by the Web Content Accessibiity Guidelines (WCAG) success criteria (SC) 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum). This SC was written by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure that people with low vision or color deficiencies are able to read (perceive) important content on a web page. It goes beyond color choices to ensure text stands out on the background it's placed on.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are some of the tools available to test the accessibility of a website or web application?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
There are multiple tools that can help you to find for accessibility issues in your website or application.
Check for issues in your website:
-   Lighthouse from Google, it provides an option for accessibility testing, it will check for the compliance of different accessibility standards and give you an score with details on the different issues
-   Axe Coconut from DequeLabs, it is a Chrome extension that adds a tab in the Developer tools, it will check for accessibility issues and it will classify them by severity and suggest possible solutions
Check for issues in your code: \* Jest Axe, you can add unit tests for accessibility \* React Axe, test your React application with the axe-core accessibility testing library. Results will show in the Chrome DevTools console. \* eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, pairing this plugin with an editor lint plugin, you can bake accessibility standards into your application in real-time.
Check for individual issues: \* Color Contrast checkers \* Use a screen reader \* Use only keyboard to navigate your site

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the Accessibility Tree?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The Accessibility Tree is a structure produced by the browser's Accessibility APIs which provides accessibility information to assistive technologies such as screen readers. It runs parallel to the DOM and is similar to the DOM API, but with much fewer nodes, because a lot of that information is only useful for visual presentation. By writing semantic HTML we can take advantage of this process in creating an accessible experience for our users.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute on images?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The `alt` attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user cannot view it. The `alt` attribute should be used to describe any images except those which only serve a decorative purpose, in which case it should be left empty.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Decorative images should have an empty `alt` attribute.
-   Web crawlers use `alt` tags to understand image content, so they are considered important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
-   Put the `.` at the end of `alt` tag to improve accessibility.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are `defer` and `async` attributes on a `<script>` tag?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
If neither attribute is present, the script is downloaded and executed synchronously, and will halt parsing of the document until it has finished executing (default behavior). Scripts are downloaded and executed in the order they are encountered.
The `defer` attribute downloads the script while the document is still parsing but waits until the document has finished parsing before executing it, equivalent to executing inside a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener. `defer` scripts will execute in order.
The `async` attribute downloads the script during parsing the document but will pause the parser to execute the script before it has fully finished parsing. `async` scripts will not necessarily execute in order.
Note: both attributes must only be used if the script has a `src` attribute (i.e. not an inline script).
``` {.sourceCode .html}
<script src="myscript.js"></script>
<script src="myscript.js" defer></script>
<script src="myscript.js" async></script>
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Placing a `defer` script in the `<head>` allows the browser to download the script while the page is still parsing, and is therefore a better option than placing the script before the end of the body.
-   If the scripts rely on each other, use `defer`.
-   If the script is independent, use `async`.
-   Use `defer` if the DOM must be ready and the contents are not placed within a `DOMContentLoaded` listener.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is an `async` function?
```js
async function foo() {
  ...
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
An `async` function is a function that allows you to pause the function's execution while it waits for (`await`s) a promise to resolve. It's an abstraction on top of the Promise API that makes asynchronous operations *look* like they're synchronous.
`async` functions automatically return a Promise object. Whatever you `return` from the `async` function will be the promise's *resolution*. If instead you `throw` from the body of an `async` function, that will be how your async function *rejects* the promise it returns.
Most importantly, `async` functions are able to use the `await` keyword in their function body, which **pauses the function** until the operation after the `await` completes, and allows it to return that operation's result to a variable synchronously.
```js
// Normal promises in regular function:
function foo() {
  promiseCall()
    .then(result => {
      // do something with the result
    })
}
// async functions
async function foo() {
  const result = await promiseCall()
  // do something with the result
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   `async` functions are just syntactic sugar on top of Promises.
-   They make asynchronous operations look like synchronous operations in your function.
-   They implicitly return a promise which resolves to whatever your `async` function returns, and reject to whatever your `async` function `throw`s.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Create a function `batches` that returns the maximum number of whole batches that can be cooked from a recipe.
```js
/**
It accepts two objects as arguments: the first object is the recipe
for the food, while the second object is the available ingredients.
Each ingredient's value is a number representing how many units there are.
`batches(recipe, available)`
*/
// 0 batches can be made
batches(
  { milk: 100, butter: 50, flour: 5 },
  { milk: 132, butter: 48, flour: 51 }
)

  { milk: 100, flour: 4, sugar: 10, butter: 5 },
  { milk: 1288, flour: 9, sugar: 95 }
)
// 1 batch can be made
batches(
  { milk: 100, butter: 50, cheese: 10 },
  { milk: 198, butter: 52, cheese: 10 }
)
// 2 batches can be made
batches(
  { milk: 2, sugar: 40, butter: 20 },
  { milk: 5, sugar: 120, butter: 500 }
)
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
We must have all ingredients of the recipe available, and in quantities that are more than or equal to the number of units required. If just one of the ingredients is not available or lower than needed, we cannot make a single batch.
Use `Object.keys()` to return the ingredients of the recipe as an array, then use `Array.prototype.map()` to map each ingredient to the ratio of available units to the amount required by the recipe. If one of the ingredients required by the recipe is not available at all, the ratio will evaluate to `NaN`, so the logical OR operator can be used to fallback to `0` in this case.
Use the spread `...` operator to feed the array of all the ingredient ratios into `Math.min()` to determine the lowest ratio. Passing this entire result into `Math.floor()` rounds down to return the maximum number of whole batches.
```js
const batches = (recipe, available) =>
  Math.floor(
    Math.min(...Object.keys(recipe).map(k => available[k] / recipe[k] || 0))
  )

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is CSS BEM?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The BEM methodology is a naming convention for CSS classes in order to keep CSS more maintainable by defining namespaces to solve scoping issues. BEM stands for Block Element Modifier which is an explanation for its structure. A Block is a standalone component that is reusable across projects and acts as a "namespace" for sub components (Elements). Modifiers are used as flags when a Block or Element is in a certain state or is different in structure or style.
``` {.sourceCode .css}
/* block component */
.block {
}
/* element */
.block__element {
}
/* modifier */
.block__element--modifier {
}
```
Here is an example with the class names on markup:
``` {.sourceCode .html}
<nav class="navbar">
  <a href="/" class="navbar__link navbar__link--active"></a>
  <a href="/" class="navbar__link"></a>
  <a href="/" class="navbar__link"></a>
</nav>
```
In this case, `navbar` is the Block, `navbar__link` is an Element that makes no sense outside of the `navbar` component, and `navbar__link--active` is a Modifier that indicates a different state for the `navbar__link` Element.
Since Modifiers are verbose, many opt to use `is-*` flags instead as modifiers.
``` {.sourceCode .html}
<a href="/" class="navbar__link is-active"></a>
```
These must be chained to the Element and never alone however, or there will be scope issues.
``` {.sourceCode .css}
.navbar__link.is-active {
}
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is Big O Notation?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. The best algorithms will execute the fastest and have the simplest complexity.
Algorithms don't always perform the same and may vary based on the data they are supplied. While in some cases they will execute quickly, in other cases they will execute slowly, even with the same number of elements to deal with.
In these examples, the base time is 1 element = `1ms`.
###   <span style="color:red;"> O(1)
```js
arr[arr.length - 1]
```
-   1000 elements = `1ms`
Constant time complexity. No matter how many elements the array has, it will theoretically take (excluding real-world variation) the same amount of time to execute.
###   <span style="color:red;"> O(N)
```js
arr.filter(fn)
```
-   1000 elements = `1000ms`
Linear time complexity. The execution time will increase linearly with the number of elements the array has. If the array has 1000 elements and the function takes 1ms to execute, 7000 elements will take 7ms to execute. This is because the function must iterate through all elements of the array before returning a result.
###   <span style="color:red;"> O([1, N])
```js
arr.some(fn)
```
-   1000 elements = `1ms <= x <= 1000ms`
The execution time varies depending on the data supplied to the function, it may return very early or very late. The best case here is O(1) and the worst case is O(N).
###   <span style="color:red;"> O(NlogN)
```js
arr.sort(fn)
```
-   1000 elements \~= `10000ms`
Browsers usually implement the quicksort algorithm for the `sort()` method and the average time complexity of quicksort is O(NlgN). This is very efficient for large collections.
###   <span style="color:red;"> O(N\^2)
```js
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
    // ...
  }
}
```
-   1000 elements = `1000000ms`
The execution time rises quadratically with the number of elements. Usually the result of nesting loops.
###   <span style="color:red;"> O(N!)
```js
const permutations = arr => {
  if (arr.length <= 2) return arr.length === 2 ? [arr, [arr[1], arr[0]]] : arr
  return arr.reduce(
    (acc, item, i) =>
      acc.concat(
        permutations([...arr.slice(0, i), ...arr.slice(i + 1)]).map(val => [
          item,
          ...val
        ])
      ),
    []
  )
}
```
-   1000 elements = `Infinity` (practically) ms
The execution time rises extremely fast with even just 1 addition to the array.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Be wary of nesting loops as execution time increases exponentially.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the purpose of cache busting and how can you achieve it?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Browsers have a cache to temporarily store files on websites so they don't need to be re-downloaded again when switching between pages or reloading the same page. The server is set up to send headers that tell the browser to store the file for a given amount of time. This greatly increases website speed and preserves bandwidth.
However, it can cause problems when the website has been changed by developers because the user's cache still references old files. This can either leave them with old functionality or break a website if the cached CSS and JavaScript files are referencing elements that no longer exist, have moved or have been renamed.
Cache busting is the process of forcing the browser to download the new files. This is done by naming the file something different to the old file.
A common technique to force the browser to re-download the file is to append a query string to the end of the file.
-   `src="js/script.js"` =\> `src="js/script.js?v=2"`
The browser considers it a different file but prevents the need to change the file name.

###   <span style="color:red;"> How can you avoid callback hells?
```js

  getMoreData(a, function(b) {
    getMoreData(b, function(c) {
      getMoreData(c, function(d) {
        getMoreData(d, function(e) {
          // ...
        })
      })
    })
  })
})
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Refactoring the functions to return promises and using `async/await` is usually the best option. Instead of supplying the functions with callbacks that cause deep nesting, they return a promise that can be `await`ed and will be resolved once the data has arrived, allowing the next line of code to be evaluated in a sync-like fashion.
The above code can be restructured like so:
```js
async function asyncAwaitVersion() {
  const a = await getData()
  const b = await getMoreData(a)
  const c = await getMoreData(b)
  const d = await getMoreData(c)
  const e = await getMoreData(d)
  // ...
}
```
There are lots of ways to solve the issue of callback hells:
-   Modularization: break callbacks into independent functions
-   Use a control flow library, like async
-   Use generators with Promises
-   Use async/await (from v7 on)
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   As an efficient JavaScript developer, you have to avoid the constantly growing indentation level, produce clean and readable code and be able to handle complex flows.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of `setState`?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The callback function is invoked when `setState` has finished and the component gets rendered. Since `setState` is asynchronous, the callback function is used for any post action.
```js
setState({ name: "sudheer" }, () => {
  console.log("The name has updated and component re-rendered")
})
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   The callback function is invoked after `setState` finishes and is used for any post action.
-   It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather this callback function.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Which is the preferred option between callback refs and findDOMNode()?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Callback refs are preferred over the `findDOMNode()` API, due to the fact that `findDOMNode()` prevents certain improvements in React in the future.
```js
// Legacy approach using findDOMNode()
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView()
  }
  render() {
    return <div />
  }
}
// Recommended approach using callback refs
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.node.scrollIntoView()
  }
  render() {
    return <div ref={node => (this.node = node)} />
  }
}
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a callback? Can you show an example using one?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Callbacks are functions passed as an argument to another function to be executed once an event has occurred or a certain task is complete, often used in asynchronous code. Callback functions are invoked later by a piece of code but can be declared on initialization without being invoked.
As an example, event listeners are asynchronous callbacks that are only executed when a specific event occurs.
```js
function onClick() {
  console.log("The user clicked on the page.")
}
document.addEventListener("click",
    onClick)
```
However, callbacks can also be synchronous. The following `map` function takes a callback function that is invoked synchronously for each iteration of the loop (array element).
```js
const map = (arr, callback) => {
  const result = []
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    result.push(callback(arr[i], i))
  }
  return result
}
map([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n => n * 2) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the `children` prop?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
`children` is part of the props object passed to components that allows components to be passed as data to other components, providing the ability to compose components cleanly. There are a number of methods available in the React API to work with this prop, such as `React.Children.map`, `React.Children.forEach`, `React.Children.count`, `React.Children.only` and `React.Children.toArray`. A simple usage example of the children prop is as follows:
```js
function GenericBox({ children }) {
  return <div className="container">{children}</div>
}
function App() {
  return (
    <GenericBox>
      <span>Hello</span> <span>World</span>
    </GenericBox>
  )
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:

###   <span style="color:red;"> Why does React use `className` instead of `class` like in HTML?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
React's philosophy in the beginning was to align with the browser DOM API rather than HTML, since that more closely represents how elements are created. Setting a `class` on an element meant using the `className` API:
```js
const element = document.createElement("div")
element.className = "hello"
```
Additionally, before ES5, reserved words could not be used in objects:
```js
const element = {
  attributes: {
    class: "hello"
  }
}
```
In IE8, this will throw an error.
In modern environments, destructuring will throw an error if trying to assign to a variable:
```js
const { class } = this.props // Error
const { className } = this.props // All good
const { class: className } =
    this.props // All good, but
        cumbersome!
```
However, `class` *can* be used as a prop without problems, as seen in other libraries like Preact. React currently allows you to use `class`, but will throw a warning and convert it to `className` under the hood. There is currently an open thread (as of January 2019) discussing changing `className` to `class` to reduce confusion.

###   <span style="color:red;"> How do you clone an object in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Using the object spread operator `...`, the object's own enumerable properties can be copied into the new object. This creates a shallow clone of the object.
```js
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 }
const shallowClone = { ...obj }
```
With this technique, prototypes are ignored. In addition, nested objects are not cloned, but rather their references get copied, so nested objects still refer to the same objects as the original. Deep-cloning is much more complex in order to effectively clone any type of object (Date, RegExp, Function, Set, etc) that may be nested within the object.
Other alternatives include:
-   `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` can be used to deep-clone a simple object, but it is CPU-intensive and only accepts valid JSON (therefore it strips functions and does not allow circular references).
-   `Object.assign({}, obj)` is another alternative.
-   `Object.keys(obj).reduce((acc, key) => (acc[key] = obj[key], acc), {})` is another more verbose alternative that shows the concept in greater depth.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   JavaScript passes objects by reference, meaning that nested objects get their references copied, instead of their values.
-   The same method can be used to merge two objects.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a closure? Can you give a useful example of one?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A closure is a function defined inside another function and has access to its lexical scope even when it is executing outside its lexical scope. The closure has access to variables in three scopes:
-   Variables declared in its own scope
-   Variables declared in the scope of the parent function
-   Variables declared in the global scope
In JavaScript, all functions are closures because they have access to the outer scope, but most functions don't utilise the usefulness of closures: the persistence of state. Closures are also sometimes called stateful functions because of this.
In addition, closures are the only way to store private data that can't be accessed from the outside in JavaScript. They are the key to the UMD (Universal Module Definition) pattern, which is frequently used in libraries that only expose a public API but keep the implementation details private, preventing name collisions with other libraries or the user's own code.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Closures are useful because they let you associate data with a function that operates on that data.
-   A closure can substitute an object with only a single method.
-   Closures can be used to emulate private properties and methods.

###   <span style="color:red;"> How do you compare two objects in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Even though two different objects can have the same properties with equal values, they are not considered equal when compared using `==` or `===`. This is because they are being compared by their reference (location in memory), unlike primitive values which are compared by value.
In order to test if two objects are equal in structure, a helper function is required. It will iterate through the own properties of each object to test if they have the same values, including nested objects. Optionally, the prototypes of the objects may also be tested for equivalence by passing `true` as the 3rd argument.
Note: this technique does not attempt to test equivalence of data structures other than plain objects, arrays, functions, dates and primitive values.
```js
function isDeepEqual(obj1, obj2, testPrototypes = false) {
  if (obj1 === obj2) {
    return true
  }
  if (typeof obj1 === "function" && typeof obj2 === "function") {
    return obj1.toString() === obj2.toString()
  }
  if (obj1 instanceof Date && obj2 instanceof Date) {
    return obj1.getTime() === obj2.getTime()
  }
  if (
    Object.prototype.toString.call(obj1) !==
      Object.prototype.toString.call(obj2) ||
    typeof obj1 !== "object"
  ) {
    return false
  }
  const prototypesAreEqual = testPrototypes
    ? isDeepEqual(
        Object.getPrototypeOf(obj1),
        Object.getPrototypeOf(obj2),
        true
      )
    : true
  const obj1Props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1)
  const obj2Props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2)
  return (
    obj1Props.length === obj2Props.length &&
    prototypesAreEqual &&
    obj1Props.every(prop => isDeepEqual(obj1[prop], obj2[prop]))
  )
}
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is context?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. For example, authenticated user, locale preference, UI theme need to be accessed in the application by many components.
```js
const { Provider, Consumer } = React.createContext(defaultValue)
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Context provides a way to pass data through a tree of React components, without having to manually pass props.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is CORS?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or CORS is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to grant a browser permission to access resources from a server at an origin different from the website origin.
An example of a cross-origin request is a web application served from `http://mydomain.com` that uses AJAX to make a request for `http://yourdomain.com`.
For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated by JavaScript. `XMLHttpRequest` and `fetch` follow the same-origin policy, meaning a web application using those APIs can only request HTTP resources from the same origin the application was accessed, unless the response from the other origin includes the correct CORS headers.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   CORS behavior is not an error,  it's a security mechanism to protect users.
-   CORS is designed to prevent a malicious website that a user may unintentionally visit from making a request to a legitimate website to read their personal data or perform actions against their will.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Describe the layout of the CSS Box Model and briefly describe each component.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
`Content`: The inner-most part of the box filled with content, such as text, an image, or video player. It has the dimensions `content-box width` and `content-box height`.
`Padding`: The transparent area surrounding the content. It has dimensions `padding-box width` and `padding-box height`.
`Border`: The area surrounding the padding (if any) and content. It has dimensions `border-box width` and `border-box height`.
*Margin*: The transparent outer-most layer that surrounds the border. It separates the element from other elements in the DOM. It has dimensions `margin-box width` and `margin-box height`.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are the advantages of using CSS preprocessors?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
CSS preprocessors add useful functionality that native CSS does not have, and generally make CSS neater and more maintainable by enabling DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles. Their terse syntax for nested selectors cuts down on repeated code. They provide variables for consistent theming (however, CSS variables have largely replaced this functionality) and additional tools like color functions (`lighten`, `darken`, `transparentize`, etc), mixins, and loops that make CSS more like a real programming language and gives the developer more power to generate complex CSS.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between '+' and '\~' sibling selectors?.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The General Sibling Selector `~` selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.
The following example selects all `<p>` elements that are siblings of `<div>` elements:
``` {.sourceCode .css}
div ~ p {
  background-color: blue;
}
```
The Adjacent Sibling Selector `+` selects all elements that are the adjacent siblings of a specified element.
The following example will select all `<p>` elements that are placed immediately after `<div>` elements:
``` {.sourceCode .css}
div + p {
  background-color: red;
}
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> Can you describe how CSS specificity works?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Assuming the browser has already determined the set of rules for an element, each rule is assigned a matrix of values, which correspond to the following from highest to lowest specificity:
-   Inline rules (binary - 1 or 0)
-   Number of id selectors
-   Number of class, pseudo-class and attribute selectors
-   Number of tags and pseudo-element selectors
When two selectors are compared, the comparison is made on a per-column basis (e.g. an id selector will always be higher than any amount of class selectors, as ids have higher specificity than classes). In cases of equal specificity between multiple rules, the rules that comes last in the page's style sheet is deemed more specific and therefore applied to the element.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is debouncing?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Debouncing is a process to add some delay before executing a function. It is commonly used with DOM event listeners to improve the performance of page. It is a technique which allow us to "group" multiple sequential calls in a single one. A raw DOM event listeners can easily trigger 20+ events per second. A debounced function will only be called once the delay has passed.
```js
const debounce = (func, delay) => { 
  let debounceTimer;
  return function() { 
    const context = this;
    const args = arguments; 
      clearTimeout(debounceTimer); 
        debounceTimer = setTimeout(() => func.apply(context, args), delay);
  }
}
window.addEventListere('scroll', debounce(function() {
  // Do stuff, this function will be called after a delay of 1 second
}, 1000));
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the DOM?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a cross-platform API that treats HTML and XML documents as a tree structure consisting of nodes. These nodes (such as elements and text nodes) are objects that can be programmatically manipulated and any visible changes made to them are reflected live in the document. In a browser, this API is available to JavaScript where DOM nodes can be manipulated to change their styles, contents, placement in the document, or interacted with through event listeners.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API.
-   The DOM is constructed progressively in the browser as a page loads, which is why scripts are often placed at the bottom of a page, in the `<head>` with a `defer` attribute, or inside a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener. Scripts that manipulate DOM nodes should be run after the DOM has been constructed to avoid errors.
-   `document.getElementById()` and `document.querySelector()` are common functions for selecting DOM nodes.
-   Setting the `innerHTML` property to a new value runs the string through the HTML parser, offering an easy way to append dynamic HTML content to a node.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between the equality operators `==` and `===`?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Triple equals (`===`) checks for strict equality, which means both the type and value must be the same. Double equals (`==`) on the other hand first performs type coercion so that both operands are of the same type and then applies strict comparison.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Whenever possible, use triple equals to test equality because loose equality `==` can have unintuitive results.
-   Type coercion means the values are converted into the same type.
-   Mention of falsy values and their comparison.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between an element and a component in React?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
An element is a plain JavaScript object that represents a DOM node or component. Elements are pure and never mutated, and are cheap to create.
A component is a function or class. Components can have state and take props as input and return an element tree as output (although they can represent generic containers or wrappers and don't necessarily have to emit DOM). Components can initiate side effects in lifecycle methods (e.g. AJAX requests, DOM mutations, interfacing with 3rd party libraries) and may be expensive to create.
```js
const Component = () => "Hello"
const componentElement = <Component />
const domNodeElement = <div />
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Elements are immutable, plain objects that describe the DOM nodes or components you want to render.
-   Components can be either classes or functions, that take props as an input and return an element tree as the output.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between `em` and `rem` units?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Both `em` and `rem` units are based on the `font-size` CSS property. The only difference is where they inherit their values from.
-   `em` units inherit their value from the `font-size` of the parent element
-   `rem` units inherit their value from the `font-size` of the root element (`html`)
In most browsers, the `font-size` of the root element is set to `16px` by default.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are error boundaries in React?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.
Class components become error boundaries if they define either (or both) of the lifecycle methods `static getDerivedStateFromError()` or `componentDidCatch().`
```js
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { hasError: false }
  }
  // Use componentDidCatch to log the error
  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    logErrorToMyService(error, info)
  }
  // use getDerivedStateFromError to update state
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Display fallback UI
     return { hasError: true };
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>
    }
    return this.props.children
  }
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Error boundaries only catch errors in the components below them in the tree. An error boundary can't catch an error within itself.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is event delegation and why is it useful? Can you show an example of how to use it?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Event delegation is a technique of delegating events to a single common ancestor. Due to event bubbling, events "bubble" up the DOM tree by executing any handlers progressively on each ancestor element up to the root that may be listening to it.
DOM events provide useful information about the element that initiated the event via `Event.target`. This allows the parent element to handle behavior as though the target element was listening to the event, rather than all children of the parent or the parent itself.
This provides two main benefits:
-   It increases performance and reduces memory consumption by only needing to register a single event listener to handle potentially thousands of elements.
-   If elements are dynamically added to the parent, there is no need to register new event listeners for them.
Instead of:
```js
document.querySelectorAll("button").forEach(button => {
  button.addEventListener("click", handleButtonClick)
})
```
Event delegation involves using a condition to ensure the child target matches our desired element:
```js
document.addEventListener("click", e => {
  if (e.target.closest("button")) {
    handleButtonClick()
  }
})
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is event-driven programming?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Event-driven programming is a paradigm that involves building applications that send and receive events. When the program emits events, the program responds by running any callback functions that are registered to that event and context, passing in associated data to the function. With this pattern, events can be emitted into the wild without throwing errors even if no functions are subscribed to it.
A common example of this is the pattern of elements listening to DOM events such as `click` and `mouseenter`, where a callback function is run when the event occurs.
```js
document.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  // This callback function is run when the user
  // clicks on the document.
})
```
Without the context of the DOM, the pattern may look like this:
```js
const hub = createEventHub()
hub.on("message", function(data) {
  console.log(`${data.username} said ${data.text}`)
})
hub.emit("message", {
  username: "John",
  text: "Hello?"
})
```
With this implementation, `on` is the way to *subscribe* to an event, while `emit` is the way to *publish* the event.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Follows a publish-subscribe pattern.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between an expression and a statement in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
There are two main syntactic categories in JavaScript: expressions and statements. A third one is both together, referred to as an expression statement. They are roughly summarized as:
-   **Expression**: produces a value
-   **Statement**: performs an action
-   **Expression statement**: produces a value and performs an action
A general rule of thumb:
> If you can print it or assign it to a variable, it's an expression. If you can't, it's a statement.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Statements

Statements appear as instructions that do something but don't produce values.
```js
// Assign `x` to the absolute value of `y`.
var x
if (y >= 0) {
  x = y
} else {
  x = -y
}
```
The only expression in the above code is `y >= 0` which produces a value, either `true` or `false`. A value is not produced by other parts of the code.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Expressions
Expressions produce a value. They can be passed around to functions because the interpreter replaces them with the value they resolve to.
```js
5 + 5 // => 10
lastCharacter("input") // => "t"
true === true // => true
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Expression statements
There is an equivalent version of the set of statements used before as an expression using the conditional operator:
```js
// Assign `x` as the absolute value of `y`.
var x = y >= 0 ? y : -y
```
This is both an expression and a statement, because we are declaring a variable `x` (statement) as an evaluation (expression).

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are truthy and falsy values in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A value is either truthy or falsy depending on how it is evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy means false-like and truthy means true-like. Essentially, they are values that are coerced to `true` or `false` when performing certain operations.
There are 6 falsy values in JavaScript. They are:
-   `false`
-   `undefined`
-   `null`
-   `""` (empty string)
-   `NaN`
-   `0` (both `+0` and `-0`)
Every other value is considered truthy.
A value's truthiness can be examined by passing it into the `Boolean` function.
```js
Boolean("") // false
Boolean([]) // true
```
There is a shortcut for this using the logical NOT `!` operator. Using `!` once will convert a value to its inverse boolean equivalent (i.e. not false is true), and `!` once more will convert back, thus effectively converting the value to a boolean.
```js
!!"" // false
!![] // true
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What does `0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3` evaluate to?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
It evaluates to `false` because JavaScript uses the IEEE 754 standard for Math and it makes use of 64-bit floating numbers. This causes precision errors when doing decimal calculations, in short, due to computers working in Base 2 while decimal is Base 10.
```js
0.1 + 0.2 // 0.30000000000000004
```
A solution to this problem would be to use a function that determines if two numbers are approximately equal by defining an error margin (epsilon) value that the difference between two values should be less than.
```js
const approxEqual = (n1, n2, epsilon = 0.0001) => Math.abs(n1 - n2) < epsilon
approxEqual(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3) // true

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a focus ring? What is the correct solution to handle them?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A focus ring is a visible outline given to focusable elements such as buttons and anchor tags. It varies depending on the vendor, but generally it appears as a blue outline around the element to indicate it is currently focused.
In the past, many people specified `outline: 0;` on the element to remove the focus ring. However, this causes accessibility issues for keyboard users because the focus state may not be clear. When not specified though, it causes an unappealing blue ring to appear around an element.
In recent times, frameworks like Bootstrap have opted to use a more appealing `box-shadow` outline to replace the default focus ring. However, this is still not ideal for mouse users.
The best solution is an upcoming pseudo-selector `:focus-visible` which can be polyfilled today with JavaScript. It will only show a focus ring if the user is using a keyboard and leave it hidden for mouse users. This keeps both aesthetics for mouse use and accessibility for keyboard use.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between the array methods `map()` and `forEach()`?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Both methods iterate through the elements of an array. `map()` maps each element to a new element by invoking the callback function on each element and returning a new array. On the other hand, `forEach()` invokes the callback function for each element but does not return a new array. `forEach()` is generally used when causing a side effect on each iteration, whereas `map()` is a common functional programming technique.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Use `forEach()` if you need to iterate over an array and cause mutations to the elements without needing to return values to generate a new array.
-   `map()` is the right choice to keep data immutable where each value of the original array is mapped to a new array.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are fragments?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Fragments allow a React component to return multiple elements without a wrapper, by grouping the children without adding extra elements to the DOM. Fragments offer better performance, lower memory usage, a cleaner DOM and can help in dealing with certain CSS mechanisms (e.g. tables, Flexbox and Grid).
```js
render() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <ChildA />
      <ChildB />
      <ChildC />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
// Short syntax supported by Babel 7
render() {
  return (
    <>
      <ChildA />
      <ChildB />
      <ChildC />
    </>
  );
}
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is functional programming?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Functional programming is a paradigm in which programs are built in a declarative manner using pure functions that avoid shared state and mutable data. Functions that always return the same value for the same input and don't produce side effects are the pillar of functional programming. Many programmers consider this to be the best approach to software development as it reduces bugs and cognitive load.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Cleaner, more concise development experience
-   Simple function composition
-   Features of JavaScript that enable functional programming (`.map`, `.reduce` etc.)

###   <span style="color:red;"> Describe your thoughts on how a single page web app should handle focus when changing routes
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Single page applications make use of client-side rendering. This means that 'examplesite.com' and 'examplesite.com/page2' are actually the same HTML web page, but the client app decides what content to drop into that single page at runtime. Your user never actually "leaves" the page, and this causes some accessibility issues in terms of focus.
Unless focus is explicitly managed in the app, a scenario like this may happen:
1.  User visits 'examplesite.com'
2.  User clicks a link to go to another route: 'examplesite.com/product1'
3.  Client app changes the visible content to show the details for this new route (e.g. some info about Product 1)
4.  Focus is still on the link that was clicked in step 2
5.  If a user uses the keyboard or screen reader to now try and read the content, the focused starting point is in the middle of the page on an element no longer visible
Many strategies have been proposed in handling this situation, all involving explicitly managing the focus when the new page content is rendered. [Recent research by GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-07-11-user-testing-accessible-client-routing/) suggests the best approach is:
1.  User visits 'examplesite.com'
2.  User clicks a link to go to another route: 'examplesite.com/product1'
3.  Client app changes the visible content to show the details for this new route (e.g. some info about Product 1)
4.  Client app manually places focus on the main header at the top of the page (almost always this will be the H1 element)
By doing so, focus is reset to the top of the page, ready for the user to begin exploring the new content. This solution requires inserting the main heading into the start of tabbing order with `tabindex="-1"`.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Focus issues caused by client-side rendering, instead of server-side
-   Focus should not be left on elements no longer visible on the page
-   Challenges faced by screen reader users and users utilising keyboard navigation

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are higher-order components?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component. It is a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature. Higher-order components are like **pure components** because they accept any dynamically provided child component, but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.
```js
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent)
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:

```js
var foo = 1
var foobar = function() {
  console.log(foo)
  var foo = 2
}
foobar()
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Due to hoisting, the local variable `foo` is declared before the `console.log` method is called. This means the local variable `foo` is passed as an argument to `console.log()` instead of the global one declared outside of the function. However, since the value is not hoisted with the variable declaration, the output will be `undefined`, not `2`.

-   [MDN docs for hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)
###   <span style="color:red;"> How does hoisting work in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are put into memory during the compile phase. This means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.
However, the value is not hoisted with the declaration.
The following snippet:
```js
console.log(hoist)
var hoist = "value"
```
is equivalent to:
```js
var hoist
console.log(hoist)
hoist = "value"
```
Therefore logging `hoist` outputs `undefined` to the console, not `"value"`.
Hoisting also allows you to invoke a function declaration before it appears to be declared in a program.
```js
myFunction() // No error; logs "hello"
function myFunction() {
  console.log("hello")
}
```
But be wary of function expressions that are assigned to a variable:
```js
myFunction() // Error: `myFunction` is not a function
var myFunction = function() {
  console.log("hello")
}
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> Can a web page contain multiple `<header>` elements? What about `<footer>` elements?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Yes to both. The W3 documents state that the tags represent the header(`<header>`) and footer(`<footer>`) areas of their nearest ancestor "section". So not only can the page `<body>` contain a header and a footer, but so can every `<article>` and `<section>` element.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Discuss the differences between an HTML specification and a browser's implementation thereof.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
HTML specifications such as `HTML5` define a set of rules that a document must adhere to in order to be "valid" according to that specification. In addition, a specification provides instructions on how a browser must interpret and render such a document.
A browser is said to "support" a specification if it handles valid documents according to the rules of the specification. As of yet, no browser supports all aspects of the `HTML5` specification (although all of the major browser support most of it), and as a result, it is necessary for the developer to confirm whether the aspect they are making use of will be supported by all of the browsers on which they hope to display their content. This is why cross-browser support continues to be a headache for developers, despite the improved specificiations.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   `HTML5` defines some rules to follow for an invalid `HTML5` document (i.e., one that contains syntactical errors)
-   However, invalid documents may contain anything, so it's impossible for the specification to handle all possibilities comprehensively.
-   Thus, many decisions about how to handle malformed documents are left up to the browser.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
In HTML, the attribute name is in all lowercase and is given a string invoking a function defined somewhere:

```
In React, the attribute name is camelCase and are passed the function reference inside curly braces:
```js
<button onClick={handleClick} />
```
In HTML, `false` can be returned to prevent default behavior, whereas in React `preventDefault` has to be called explicitly.
``` {.sourceCode .html}
<a href="#" onclick="console.log('The link was clicked.'); return false" />
```
```js

-   `<section>` is a flexible container for holding content that shares a common informational theme or purpose.
-   `<footer>` is used to hold information that should appear at the end of a section of content and contain additional information about the section. Author's name, copyright information, and related links are typical examples of such content.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is HTML5 Web Storage? Explain `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
With HTML5, web pages can store data locally within the user's browser. The data is stored in name/value pairs, and a web page can only access data stored by itself.
**Differences between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` regarding lifetime:**
-   Data stored through `localStorage` is permanent: it does not expire and remains stored on the user's computer until a web app deletes it or the user asks the browser to delete it.
-   `sessionStorage` has the same lifetime as the top-level window or browser tab in which the data got stored. When the tab is permanently closed, any data stored through `sessionStorage` is deleted.
**Differences between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` regarding storage scope:** Both forms of storage are scoped to the document origin so that documents with different origins will never share the stored objects.
-   `sessionStorage` is also scoped on a per-window basis. Two browser tabs with documents from the same origin have separate `sessionStorage` data.
-   Unlike in `localStorage`, the same scripts from the same origin can't access each other's `sessionStorage` when opened in different tabs.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Earlier, this was done with cookies.
-   The storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) than with cookies and its faster.
-   The data is never transferred to the server and can only be used if the client specifically asks for it.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the reason for wrapping the entire contents of a JavaScript source file in a function that is immediately invoked?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
This technique is very common in JavaScript libraries. It creates a closure around the entire contents of the file which creates a private namespace and thereby helps avoid potential name clashes between different JavaScript modules and libraries. The function is immediately invoked so that the namespace (library name) is assigned the return value of the function.
```js
const myLibrary = (function() {
  var privateVariable = 2
  return {
    publicMethod: () => privateVariable
  }
})()
privateVariable // ReferenceError
myLibrary.publicMethod() // 2

###   <span style="color:red;"> Explain the differences between imperative and declarative programming.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
These two types of programming can roughly be summarized as:
-   Imperative: **how** to achieve something
-   Declarative: **what** should be achieved
A common example of declarative programming is CSS. The developer specifies CSS properties that describe what something should look like rather than how to achieve it. The "how" is abstracted away by the browser.
On the other hand, imperative programming involves the steps required to achieve something. In JavaScript, the differences can be contrasted like so:
###   <span style="color:red;"> Imperative
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const numbersDoubled = []
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  numbersDoubled[i] = numbers[i] * 2
}
```
We manually loop over the numbers of the array and assign the new index as the number doubled.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Declarative
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const numbersDoubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2)
```
We declare that the new array is mapped to a new one where each value is doubled.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Declarative programming often works with functions and expressions. Imperative programming frequently uses statements and relies on low-level features that cause mutations, while declarative programming has a strong focus on abstraction and purity.
-   Declarative programming is more terse and easier to process at a glance.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are inline conditional expressions?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Since a JSX element tree is one large expression, you cannot embed statements inside. Conditional expressions act as a replacement for statements to use inside the tree.
For example, this won't work:
```js
function App({ messages, isVisible }) {
  return (
    <div>
      if (messages.length > 0) {
        <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>
      } else {
        <h2>You have no unread messages.</h2>
      }
      if (isVisible) {
        <p>I am visible.</p>
      }
    </div>
  )
}
```
Logical AND `&&` and the ternary `? :` operator replace the `if`/`else` statements.
```js
function App({ messages, isVisible }) {
  return (

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a key? What are the benefits of using it in lists?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Keys are a special string attribute that helps React identify which items have been changed, added or removed. They are used when rendering array elements to give them a stable identity. Each element's key must be unique (e.g. IDs from the data or indexes as a last resort).
```js
const todoItems = todos.map(todo => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>)
```
-   Using indexes as keys is not recommended if the order of items may change, as it might negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.
-   If you extract list items as a separate component then apply keys on the list component instead of the `<li>` tag.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Keys give elements in a collection a stable identity and help React identify changes.
-   You should avoid using indexes as keys if the order of items may change.
-   You should lift the key up to the component, instead of the `<li>` element, if you extract list items as components.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are landmark roles and how can they be useful?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Landmark roles is a way to identify different sections of a page like the main content or a navigation region. The Landmarks helps assistive technology users to navigate a page, allowing them skip over areas of it.
For example,
``` {.sourceCode .html}
<div id="header" role="banner">Header of the Page</div>
<div id="content" role="main">Main Content Goes Here</div>
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between lexical scoping and dynamic scoping?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Lexical scoping refers to when the location of a function's definition determines which variables you have access to. On the other hand, dynamic scoping uses the location of the function's invocation to determine which variables are available.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Lexical scoping is also known as static scoping.
-   Lexical scoping in JavaScript allows for the concept of closures.
-   Most languages use lexical scoping because it tends to promote source code that is more easily understood.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are the lifecycle methods in React?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
`getDerivedStateFromProps`: Executed before rendering on the initial mount and all component updates. Used to update the state based on changes in props over time. Has rare use cases, like tracking component animations during the lifecycle. There are only few cases where this makes sense to use over other lifecycle methods. It expects to return an object that will be the the new state, or null to update nothing. This method does not have access to the component instance either.
`componentDidMount`: Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up eventListeners should occur.
`shouldComponentUpdate`: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default, it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return a false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a rerender if component receives new prop.
`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`: Invoked right after a component render happens because of an update, before `componentDidUpdate`. Any value returned from this method will be passed to `componentDidUpdate`.
`componentDidUpdate`: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
`componentWillUnmount`: It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.
`componentDidCatch`: Used in error boundaries, which are components that implement this method. It allows the component to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the *child* component tree (below this component), log errors, and display a UI with error information.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are the different phases of the component lifecycle in React?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
There are four different phases of component's lifecycle:
**Initialization**: In this phase, the component prepares setting up the initial state and default props.
**Mounting**: The react component is ready to mount to the DOM. This phase covers the `getDerivedStateFromProps` and `componentDidMount` lifecycle methods.
**Updating**: In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state. This phase covers the `getDerivedStateFromProps`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` and `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle methods.
**Unmounting**: In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes the `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method.
**Error Handling**: In this phase, the component is called whenever there's an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor for any child component. This phase includes the `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What does lifting state up in React mean?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
When several components need to share the same data, then it is recommended to lift the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. For example, if two child components share the same data, it is recommended to move the shared state to parent instead of maintaining the local state in both child components.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is memoization?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Memoization is the process of caching the output of function calls so that subsequent calls are faster. Calling the function again with the same input will return the cached output without needing to do the calculation again.
A basic implementation in JavaScript looks like this:
```js
const memoize = fn => {
  const cache = new Map()
  return value => {
    const cachedResult = cache.get(value)
    if (cachedResult !== undefined) return cachedResult
    const result = fn(value)
    cache.set(value, result)
    return result
  }
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   The above technique returns a unary function even if the function can take multiple arguments.
-   The first function call will be slower than usual because of the overhead created by checking if a cached result exists and setting a result before returning the value.
-   Memoization increases performance on subsequent function calls but still needs to do work on the first call.

###   <span style="color:red;"> How do you ensure methods have the correct `this` context in React component classes?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. This means that their `this` context can be changed (in the case of an event handler, to the element that is listening to the event) and will not refer to the component instance. To solve this, `Function.prototype.bind()` can be used to enforce the `this` context as the component instance.
```js
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
}
handleClick() {
  // Perform some logic
}
```
-   The `bind` approach can be verbose and requires defining a `constructor`, so the new public class fields syntax is generally preferred:
```js
handleClick = () => {
  console.log('this is:', this);
}
render() {
  return (
    <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
```
-   You can also use an inline arrow function, because lexical `this` (referring to the component instance) is preserved:
```js
<button onClick={e => this.handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>
```
Note that extra re-rendering can occur using this technique because a new function reference is created on render, which gets passed down to child components and breaks `shouldComponentUpdate` / `PureComponent` shallow equality checks to prevent unnecessary re-renders. In cases where performance is important, it is preferred to go with `bind` in the constructor, or the public class fields syntax approach, because the function reference remains constant.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   You can either bind methods to the component instance context in the constructor, use public class fields syntax, or use inline arrow functions.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a MIME type and what is it used for?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
`MIME` is an acronym for `Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions`. It is used as a standard way of classifying file types over the Internet.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   A `MIME type` actually has two parts: a type and a subtype that are separated by a slash (/). For example, the `MIME type` for Microsoft Word files is `application/msword` (i.e., type is application and the subtype is msword).

###   <span style="color:red;"> Contrast mutable and immutable values, and mutating vs non-mutating methods.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The two terms can be contrasted as:
-   Mutable: subject to change
-   Immutable: cannot change
In JavaScript, objects are mutable while primitive values are immutable. This means operations performed on objects can change the original reference in some way, while operations performed on a primitive value cannot change the original value.
All `String.prototype` methods do not have an effect on the original string and return a new string. On the other hand, while some methods of `Array.prototype` do not mutate the original array reference and produce a fresh array, some cause mutations.
```js
const myString = "hello!"
myString.replace("!", "") // returns a new string, cannot mutate the original value
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3]
originalArray.push(4) // mutates originalArray, now [1, 2, 3, 4]
originalArray.concat(4) // returns a new array, does not mutate the original
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the only value not equal to itself in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer

###   <span style="color:red;"> NodeJS often uses a callback pattern where if an error is encountered during execution, this error is passed as the first argument to the callback. What are the advantages of this pattern?
```js
fs.readFile(filePath, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    // handle the error, the return is important here
    // so execution stops here
    return console.log(err)
  }
  // use the data object
  console.log(data)
})
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Advantages include:
-   Not needing to process data if there is no need to even reference it
-   Having a consistent API leads to more adoption
-   Ability to easily adapt a callback pattern that will lead to more maintainable code
As you can see from below example, the callback is called with null as its first argument if there is no error. However, if there is an error, you create an Error object, which then becomes the callback's only parameter. The callback function allows a user to easily know whether or not an error occurred.
This practice is also called the *Node.js error convention*, and this kind of callback implementations are called *error-first callbacks*.
```js
var isTrue = function(value, callback) {
  if (value === true) {
    callback(null, "Value was true.")
  } else {
    callback(new Error("Value is not true!"))
  }
}
var callback = function(error, retval) {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error)
    return
  }
  console.log(retval)
}
isTrue(false, callback)
isTrue(true, callback)
/*
  { stack: [Getter/Setter],
    arguments: undefined,
    type: undefined,
    message: 'Value is not true!' }
  Value was true.
*/
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
In JavaScript, two values discretely represent nothing - `undefined` and `null`. The concrete difference between them is that `null` is explicit, while `undefined` is implicit. When a property does not exist or a variable has not been given a value, the value is `undefined`. `null` is set as the value to explicitly indicate "no value". In essence, `undefined` is used when the nothing is not known, and `null` is used when the nothing is known.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   `typeof undefined` evaluates to `"undefined"`.
-   `typeof null` evaluates `"object"`. However, it is still a primitive value and this is considered an implementation bug in JavaScript.
-   `undefined == null` evaluates to `true`.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Describe the different ways to create an object. When should certain ways be preferred over others?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
###   <span style="color:red;"> Object literal
Often used to store one occurrence of data.
```js
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 50,
  birthday() {
    this.age++
  }
}
person.birthday() // person.age === 51
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Constructor
Often used when you need to create multiple instances of an object, each with their own data that other instances of the class cannot affect. The `new` operator must be used before invoking the constructor or the global object will be mutated.
```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name
  this.age = age
}
Person.prototype.birthday = function() {
  this.age++
}
const person1 = new Person("John", 50)
const person2 = new Person("Sally", 20)
person1.birthday() // person1.age === 51
person2.birthday() // person2.age === 21
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Factory function
Creates a new object similar to a constructor, but can store private data using a closure. There is also no need to use `new` before invoking the function or the `this` keyword. Factory functions usually discard the idea of prototypes and keep all properties and methods as own properties of the object.
```js
const createPerson = (name, age) => {
  const birthday = () => person.age++
  const person = { name, age, birthday }
  return person
}
const person = createPerson("John", 50)
person.birthday() // person.age === 51
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> `Object.create()`
Sets the prototype of the newly created object.
```js
const personProto = {
  birthday() {
    this.age++
  }
}
const person = Object.create(personProto)
person.age = 50
person.birthday() // person.age === 51
```
A second argument can also be supplied to `Object.create()` which acts as a descriptor for the new properties to be defined.
```js
Object.create(personProto, {
  age: {
    value: 50,
    writable: true,
    enumerable: true
  }
})
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Prototypes are objects that other objects inherit properties and methods from.
-   Factory functions offer private properties and methods through a closure but increase memory usage as a tradeoff, while classes do not have private properties or methods but reduce memory impact by reusing a single prototype object.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Parameters are the variable names of the function definition, while arguments are the values given to a function when it is invoked.
```js
function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2) {
  console.log(arguments[0]) // "argument1"
}
myFunction("argument1", "argument2")
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   `arguments` is an array-like object containing information about the arguments supplied to an invoked function.
-   `myFunction.length` describes the arity of a function (how many parameters it has, regardless of how many arguments it is supplied).

###   <span style="color:red;"> In which states can a Promise be?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A `Promise` is in one of these states:
-   pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
-   fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
-   rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
A pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value, or rejected with a reason (error). When either of these options happens, the associated handlers queued up by a promise's then method are called.

###   <span style="color:red;"> How to apply prop validation in React?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
When the application is running in development mode, React will automatically check for all props that we set on components to make sure they are the correct data type. For incorrect data types, it will generate warning messages in the console for development mode. They are stripped in production mode due to their performance impact. Required props are defined with `isRequired`.
For example, we define `propTypes` for component as below:
```js
import PropTypes from "prop-types"
class User extends React.Component {
  static propTypes = {
    name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    age: PropTypes.number.isRequired
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Welcome, {this.props.name}</h1>
      <h2>Age, {this.props.age}
    )
  }
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   We can define custom `propTypes`
-   Using `propTypes` is not mandatory. However, it is a good practice and can reduce bugs.

###   <span style="color:red;"> How does prototypal inheritance differ from classical inheritance?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
In the classical inheritance paradigm, object instances inherit their properties and functions from a class, which acts as a blueprint for the object. Object instances are typically created using a constructor and the `new` keyword.
In the prototypal inheritance paradigm, object instances inherit directly from other objects and are typically created using factory functions or `Object.create()`.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a pure function?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A pure function is a function that satisfies these two conditions:
-   Given the same input, the function returns the same output.
-   The function doesn't cause side effects outside of the function's scope (i.e. mutate data outside the function or data supplied to the function).
Pure functions can mutate local data within the function as long as it satisfies the two conditions above.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Pure
```js
const a = (x, y) => x + y
const b = (arr, value) => arr.concat(value)
const c = arr => [...arr].sort((a, b) => a - b)
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Impure
```js
const a = (x, y) => x + y + Math.random()
const b = (arr, value) => (arr.push(value), arr)
const c = arr => arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Pure functions are easier to reason about due to their reliability.
-   All functions should be pure unless explicitly causing a side effect (i.e. `setInnerHTML`).
-   If a function does not return a value, it is an indication that it is causing side effects.

###   <span style="color:red;"> How do you write comments inside a JSX tree in React?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Comments must be wrapped inside curly braces `{}` and use the `/* */` syntax.
``` jsx
const tree = (
  <div>
    {/* Comment */}
    <p>Text</p>
  </div>
)
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> What is recursion and when is it useful?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Recursion is the repeated application of a process. In JavaScript, recursion involves functions that call themselves repeatedly until they reach a base condition. The base condition breaks out of the recursion loop because otherwise the function would call itself indefinitely. Recursion is very useful when working with data structures that contain nesting where the number of levels deep is unknown.
For example, you may have a thread of comments returned from a database that exist in a flat array but need to be nested for display in the UI. Each comment is either a top-level comment (no parent) or is a reply to a parent comment. Comments can be a reply of a reply of a reply… we have no knowledge beforehand the number of levels deep a comment may be. This is where recursion can help.
```js
const nest = (items, id = null, link = "parent_id") =>
  items
    .filter(item => item[link] === id)
    .map(item => ({ ...item, children: nest(items, item.id) }))
const comments = [
  { id: 1, parent_id: null, text: "First reply to post." },
  { id: 2, parent_id: 1, text: "First reply to comment #1." },
  { id: 3, parent_id: 1, text: "Second reply to comment #1." },
  { id: 4, parent_id: 3, text: "First reply to comment #3." },
  { id: 5, parent_id: 4, text: "First reply to comment #4." },
  { id: 6, parent_id: null, text: "Second reply to post." }
]
nest(comments)
/*
[
  { id: 1, parent_id: null, text: "First reply to post.", children: [...] },
  { id: 6, parent_id: null, text: "Second reply to post.", children: [] }
]
*/
```
In the above example, the base condition is met if `filter()` returns an empty array. The chained `map()` won't invoke the callback function which contains the recursive call, thereby breaking the loop.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Recursion is useful when working with data structures containing an unknown number of nested structures.
-   Recursion must have a base condition to be met that breaks out of the loop or it will call itself indefinitely.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the output of the following code?
```js
const a = [1, 2, 3]
const b = [1, 2, 3]
const c = "1,2,3"
console.log(a == c)
console.log(a == b)
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The first `console.log` outputs `true` because JavaScript's compiler performs type conversion and therefore it compares to strings by their value. On the other hand, the second `console.log` outputs `false` because Arrays are Objects and Objects are compared by reference.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   JavaScript performs automatic type conversion
-   Objects are compared by reference
-   Primitives are compared by value

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are refs in React? When should they be used?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method. Refs should be used sparringly, but there are some good use cases for refs, such as:
-   Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
-   Triggering imperative animations.
-   Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.
Refs are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, assign the `ref` to the instance property within the constructor:
```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.myRef = React.createRef()
  }
  render() {
    return <div ref={this.myRef} />
  }
}
```
Refs can also be used in functional components with the help of closures.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Refs are used to return a reference to an element.
-   Refs shouldn't be overused.
-   You can create a ref using `React.createRef()` and attach to elements via the `ref` attribute.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Where and why is the `rel="noopener"` attribute used?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The `rel="noopener"` is an attribute used in `<a>` elements (hyperlinks). It prevents pages from having a `window.opener` property, which would otherwise point to the page from where the link was opened and would allow the page opened from the hyperlink to manipulate the page where the hyperlink is.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   `rel="noopener"` is applied to hyperlinks.
-   `rel="noopener"` prevents opened links from manipulating the source page.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is REST?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a software design pattern for network architecture. A RESTful web application exposes data in the form of information about its resources.
Generally, this concept is used in web applications to manage state. With most applications, there is a common theme of reading, creating, updating, and destroying data. Data is modularized into separate tables like `posts`, `users`, `comments`, and a RESTful API exposes access to this data with:
-   An identifier for the resource. This is known as the endpoint or URL for the resource.
-   The operation the server should perform on that resource in the form of an HTTP method or verb. The common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
Here is an example of the URL and HTTP method with a `posts` resource:
-   Reading: `/posts/` =\> GET
-   Creating: `/posts/new` =\> POST
-   Updating: `/posts/:id` =\> PUT
-   Destroying: `/posts/:id` =\> DELETE

###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Because of JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion (ASI), the compiler places a semicolon after `return` keyword and therefore it returns `undefined` without an error being thrown.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Are semicolons required in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Sometimes. Due to JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion, the interpreter places semicolons after most statements. This means semicolons can be omitted in most cases.
However, there are some cases where they are required. They are not required at the beginning of a block, but are if they follow a line and:
1.  The line starts with `[`
```js
const previousLine = 3
;[1, 2, previousLine].map(n => n * 2)
```
1.  The line starts with `(`
```js
const previousLine = 3
;(function() {
  // ...
})()
```
In the above cases, the interpreter does not insert a semicolon after `3`, and therefore it will see the `3` as attempting object property access or being invoked as a function, which will throw errors.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Semicolons are usually optional in JavaScript but have edge cases where they are required.
-   If you don't use semicolons, tools like Prettier will insert semicolons for you in the places where they are required on save in a text editor to prevent errors.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is short-circuit evaluation in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Short-circuit evaluation involves logical operations evaluating from left-to-right and stopping early.
```js
true || false
```
In the above sample using logical OR, JavaScript won't look at the second operand `false`, because the expression evaluates to `true` regardless. This is known as short-circuit evaluation.
This also works for logical AND.
```js
false && true
```
This means you can have an expression that throws an error if evaluated, and it won't cause issues.
```js
true || nonexistentFunction()
false && nonexistentFunction()
```
This remains true for multiple operations because of left-to-right evaluation.
```js
true || nonexistentFunction() || window.nothing.wouldThrowError
true || window.nothing.wouldThrowError
true
```
A common use case for this behavior is setting default values. If the first operand is falsy the second operand will be evaluated.
```js
const options = {}
const setting = options.setting || "default"
setting // "default"
```
Another common use case is only evaluating an expression if the first operand is truthy.
```js
// Instead of:
addEventListener("click", e => {
  if (e.target.closest("button")) {
    handleButtonClick(e)
  }
})
// You can take advantage of short-circuit evaluation:
addEventListener(
  "click",
  e => e.target.closest("button") && handleButtonClick(e)
)
```
In the above case, if `e.target` is not or does not contain an element matching the `"button"` selector, the function will not be called. This is because the first operand will be falsy, causing the second operand to not be evaluated.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Logical operations do not produce a boolean unless the operand(s) evaluate to a boolean.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are the advantages of using CSS sprites and how are they utilized?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
CSS sprites combine multiple images into one image, limiting the number of HTTP requests a browser has to make, thus improving load times. Even under the new HTTP/2 protocol, this remains true.
Under HTTP/1.1, at most one request is allowed per TCP connection. With HTTP/1.1, modern browsers open multiple parallel connections (between 2 to 8) but it is limited. With HTTP/2, all requests between the browser and the server are multiplexed on a single TCP connection. This means the cost of opening and closing multiple connections is mitigated, resulting in a better usage of the TCP connection and limits the impact of latency between the client and server. It could then become possible to load tens of images in parallel on the same TCP connection.
However, according to [benchmark results](https://blog.octo.com/en/http2-arrives-but-sprite-sets-aint-no-dead/), although HTTP/2 offers 50% improvement over HTTP/1.1, in most cases the sprite set is still faster to load than individual images.
To utilize a spritesheet in CSS, one would use certain properties, such as `background-image`, `background-position` and `background-size` to ultimately alter the `background` of an element.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   `background-image`, `background-position` and `background-size` can be used to utilize a spritesheet.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a stateful component in React?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A stateful component is a component whose behavior depends on its state. This means that two separate instances of the component if given the same props will not necessarily render the same output, unlike pure function components.
```js
// Stateful class component
class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { count: 0 }
  }
  render() {
    // ...
  }
}
// Stateful function component
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return // ...
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Stateful components have internal state that they depend on.
-   Stateful components are class components or function components that use stateful Hooks.
-   Stateful components have their state initialized in the constructor or with `useState()`.

-   [React docs on State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a stateless component?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
A stateless component is a component whose behavior does not depend on its state. Stateless components can be either functional or class components. Stateless functional components are easier to maintain and test since they are guaranteed to produce the same output given the same props. Stateless functional components should be preferred when lifecycle hooks don't need to be used.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Stateless components are independent of their state.
-   Stateless components can be either class or functional components.
-   Stateless functional components avoid the `this` keyword altogether.

###   <span style="color:red;"> Explain the difference between a static method and an instance method.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Static methods belong to a class and don't act on instances, while instance methods belong to the class prototype which is inherited by all instances of the class and acts on them.
```js
Array.isArray // static method of Array
Array.prototype.push // instance method of Array
```
In this case, the `Array.isArray` method does not make sense as an instance method of arrays because we already know the value is an array when working with it.
Instance methods could technically work as static methods, but provide terser syntax:
```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3]
arr.push(4)
Array.push(arr, 4)
```

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Synchronous means each operation must wait for the previous one to complete.
Asynchronous means an operation can occur while another operation is still being processed.
In JavaScript, all code is synchronous due to the single-threaded nature of it. However, asynchronous operations not part of the program (such as `XMLHttpRequest` or `setTimeout`) are processed outside of the main thread because they are controlled by native code (browser APIs), but callbacks part of the program will still be executed synchronously.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   JavaScript has a concurrency model based on an "event loop".
-   Functions like `alert` block the main thread so that no user input is registered until the user closes it.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the `this` keyword and how does it work?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The `this` keyword is an object that represents the context of an executing function. Regular functions can have their `this` value changed with the methods `call()`, `apply()` and `bind()`. Arrow functions implicitly bind `this` so that it refers to the context of its lexical environment, regardless of whether or not its context is set explicitly with `call()`.
Here are some common examples of how `this` works:
###   <span style="color:red;"> Object literals
`this` refers to the object itself inside regular functions if the object precedes the invocation of the function.
Properties set as `this` do not refer to the object.
```js
var myObject = {
  property: this,
  regularFunction: function() {
    return this
  },
  arrowFunction: () => {
    return this
  },
  iife: (function() {
    return this
  })()
}
myObject.regularFunction() // myObject
myObject["regularFunction"]() // my Object
myObject.property // NOT myObject; lexical `this`
myObject.arrowFunction() // NOT myObject; lexical `this`
myObject.iife // NOT myObject; lexical `this`
const regularFunction = myObject.regularFunction
regularFunction() // NOT myObject; lexical `this`
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Event listeners
`this` refers to the element listening to the event.
```js
document.body.addEventListener("click", function() {
  console.log(this) // document.body
})
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Constructors
`this` refers to the newly created object.
```js
class Example {
  constructor() {
    console.log(this) // myExample
  }
}
const myExample = new Example()
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Manual
With `call()` and `apply()`, `this` refers to the object passed as the first argument.
```js
var myFunction = function() {
  return this
}
myFunction.call({ customThis: true }) // { customThis: true }
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Unwanted `this`
Because `this` can change depending on the scope, it can have unexpected values when using regular functions.
```js
var obj = {
  arr: [1, 2, 3],
  doubleArr() {
    return this.arr.map(function(value) {
      // this is now this.arr
      return this.double(value)
    })
  },
  double() {
    return value * 2
  }
}
obj.doubleArr() // Uncaught TypeError: this.double is not a function
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   In non-strict mode, global `this` is the global object (`window` in browsers), while in strict mode global `this` is `undefined`.
-   `Function.prototype.call` and `Function.prototype.apply` set the `this` context of an executing function as the first argument, with `call` accepting a variadic number of arguments thereafter, and `apply` accepting an array as the second argument which are fed to the function in a variadic manner.
-   `Function.prototype.bind` returns a new function that enforces the `this` context as the first argument which cannot be changed by other functions.
-   If a function requires its `this` context to be changed based on how it is called, you must use the `function` keyword. Use arrow functions when you want `this` to be the surrounding (lexical) context.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is the purpose of JavaScript UI libraries/frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Hyperapp, etc?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The main purpose is to avoid manipulating the DOM directly and keep the state of an application in sync with the UI easily. Additionally, they provide the ability to create components that can be reused when they have similar functionality with minor differences, avoiding duplication which would require multiple changes whenever the structure of a component which is reused in multiple places needs to be updated.
When working with DOM manipulation libraries like jQuery, the data of an application is generally kept in the DOM itself, often as class names or `data` attributes. Manipulating the DOM to update the UI involves many extra steps and can introduce subtle bugs over time. Keeping the state separate and letting a framework handle the UI updates when the state changes reduces cognitive load. Saying you want the UI to look a certain way when the state is a certain value is the declarative way of creating an application, instead of the imperative way of manually updating the UI to reflect the new state.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   The virtual DOM is a representation of the real DOM tree in the form of plain objects, which allows a library to write code as if the entire document is thrown away and rebuilt on each change, while the real DOM only updates what needs to be changed. Comparing the new virtual DOM against the previous one leads to high efficiency as changing real DOM nodes is costly compared to recalculating the virtual DOM.
-   JSX is an extension to JavaScript that provides XML-like syntax to create virtual DOM objects which is transformed to function calls by a transpiler. It simplifies control flow (if statements/ternary expressions) compared to tagged template literals.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What does `'use strict'` do and what are some of the key benefits to using it? ###
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
Including `'use strict'` at the beginning of your JavaScript source file enables strict mode, which enforces more strict parsing and error handling of JavaScript code. It is considered a good practice and offers a lot of benefits, such as:
-   Easier debugging due to eliminating silent errors.
-   Disallows variable redefinition.
-   Prevents accidental global variables.
-   Oftentimes provides increased performance over identical code that is not running in strict mode.
-   Simplifies `eval()` and `arguments`.
-   Helps make JavaScript more secure.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   Eliminates `this` coercion, throwing an error when `this` references a value of `null` or `undefined`.
-   Throws an error on invalid usage of `delete`.
-   Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript
###   <span style="color:red;"> Additional links

###   <span style="color:red;"> What are the differences between `var`, `let`, `const` and no keyword statements?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
###   <span style="color:red;"> No keyword
When no keyword exists before a variable assignment, it is either assigning a global variable if one does not exist, or reassigns an already declared variable. In non-strict mode, if the variable has not yet been declared, it will assign the variable as a property of the global object (`window` in browsers). In strict mode, it will throw an error to prevent unwanted global variables from being created.
###   <span style="color:red;"> var
`var` was the default statement to declare a variable until ES2015. It creates a function-scoped variable that can be reassigned and redeclared. However, due to its lack of block scoping, it can cause issues if the variable is being reused in a loop that contains an asynchronous callback because the variable will continue to exist outside of the block scope.
Below, by the time the the `setTimeout` callback executes, the loop has already finished and the `i` variable is `10`, so all ten callbacks reference the same variable available in the function scope.
```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // logs `10` ten times
    console.log(i)
  })
}
/* Solutions with `var` */
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // Passed as an argument will use the value as-is in
  // that point in time
  setTimeout(console.log, 0, i)
}
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // Create a new function scope that will use the value
  // as-is in that point in time
  ;(i => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(i)
    })
  })(i)
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> let
`let` was introduced in ES2015 and is the new preferred way to declare variables that will be reassigned later. Trying to redeclare a variable again will throw an error. It is block-scoped so that using it in a loop will keep it scoped to the iteration.
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // logs 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
    console.log(i)
  })
}
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> const
`const` was introduced in ES2015 and is the new preferred default way to declare all variables if they won't be reassigned later, even for objects that will be mutated (as long as the reference to the object does not change). It is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned.
```js
const myObject = {}
myObject.prop = "hello!" // No error
myObject = "hello" // Error
```
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   All declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope.
-   However, with `let` and `const` there is a concept called the temporal dead zone (TDZ). While the declarations are still hoisted, there is a period between entering scope and being declared where they cannot be accessed.
-   Show a common issue with using `var` and how `let` can solve it, as well as a solution that keeps `var`.
-   `var` should be avoided whenever possible and prefer `const` as the default declaration statement for all variables unless they will be reassigned later, then use `let` if so.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a virtual DOM and why is it used in libraries/frameworks?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a representation of the real DOM in the form of plain JavaScript objects. These objects have properties to describe the real DOM nodes they represent: the node name, its attributes, and child nodes.
``` {.sourceCode .html}
<div class="counter">
  <h1>0</h1>
  <button>-</button>
  <button>+</button>
</div>
```
The above markup's virtual DOM representation might look like this:
```js
{
  nodeName: "div",
  attributes: { class: "counter" },
  children: [
    {
      nodeName: "h1",
      attributes: {},
      children: [0]
    },
    {
      nodeName: "button",
      attributes: {},
      children: ["-"]
    },
    {
      nodeName: "button",
      attributes: {},
      children: ["+"]
    }
  ]
}
```
The library/framework uses the virtual DOM as a means to improve performance. When the state of an application changes, the real DOM needs to be updated to reflect it. However, changing real DOM nodes is costly compared to recalculating the virtual DOM. The previous virtual DOM can be compared to the new virtual DOM very quickly in comparison.
Once the changes between the old VDOM and new VDOM have been calculated by the diffing engine of the framework, the real DOM can be patched efficiently in the least time possible to match the new state of the application.

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is WCAG? What are the differences between A, AA, and AAA compliance?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
WCAG stands for "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines". It is a standard describing how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities They have 12-13 guidelines and for each one, there are testable success criteria, which are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA. The higher the level, the higher the impact on the design of the web content. The higher the level, the web content is essentially more accessible by more users. Depending on where you live/work, there may be regulations requiring websites to meet certain levels of compliance. For instance, in Ontario, Canada, beginning January 1, 2021 all public websites and web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet AA compliance.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   A guideline for making web content more accessible

###   <span style="color:red;"> What is a cross-site scripting attack (XSS) and how do you prevent it?
###   <span style="color:red;"> Answer
XSS refers to client-side code injection where the attacker injects malicious scripts into a legitimate website or web application. This is often achieved when the application does not validate user input and freely injects dynamic HTML content.
For example, a comment system will be at risk if it does not validate or escape user input. If the comment contains unescaped HTML, the comment can inject a `<script>` tag into the website that other users will execute against their knowledge.
-   The malicious script has access to cookies which are often used to store session tokens. If an attacker can obtain a user's session cookie, they can impersonate the user.
-   The script can arbitrarily manipulate the DOM of the page the script is executing in, allowing the attacker to insert pieces of content that appear to be a real part of the website.
-   The script can use AJAX to send HTTP requests with arbitrary content to arbitrary destinations.
###   <span style="color:red;"> Don't forget:
-   On the client, using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` prevents the browser from running the string through the HTML parser which would execute scripts in it.
-   On the server, escaping HTML tags will prevent the browser from parsing the user input as actual HTML and therefore won't execute the script.

Properly configured, Far Manager allows you to navigate between files very efficiently while writing your codes. |
| ★★★ | [Code::Blocks](http://codeblocks.org/downloads) | GUI / Cross-Platform | Code::Blocks is the go-to IDE for C/C++. It's a full-fledged, versatile IDE with numerous great features. Code::Blocks is usually provided along with Vim in programming contests. |
| ★★★ | [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#chooseYourEdition) | GUI / Cross-Platform | IntelliJ IDEA is certainly one of the best IDEs for Java. It's used by most competitive programmers who use Java as their main language. Be sure to check out [CHelper](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7091-chelper), a very handy plugin written for programming contests. |
| ★★☆ | [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) | GUI / Cross-Platform | Sublime Text is an extraordinary text editor. Packed with powerful and innovative features like Multiple Carets, Minimaps and Command Palletes, it attracts a strong and engaging community. Sublime Text is highly extensible, so be sure to have [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) installed and explore perhaps one of the largest catalogue of plugins! |
| ★★☆ | [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) | GUI / Cross-Platform | Eclipse is another good IDE for Java. It's an okay alternative to Intellij IDEA (A tad inferior to IDEA by today's standards). Sometimes contests only provide Eclipse for some reason, so this might be a good incentive to try and use Eclipse. |
| ★★☆ | [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/) | GUI / Cross-Platform | CLion, produced by JetBrains - the same company who made Intellij IDEA, is a powerful IDE for C++. Free educational licenses are available OR you can try out their [EAP (Early Access Program)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/CLION/Early+Access+Program) which is still free as of Apr, 2018. You may want to turn off its code inspection feature as it will cause quite a bit of lag. |
| ★☆☆ | Other IDEs | Mixed | [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is the IDE to use in case you want to code in C#. ... Both [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are built with Electron (written in JavaScript) and therefore somewhat resource-hogging. ... [CodeLite](https://codelite.org/) is a newly rising IDE. Beware that the load-up and project-creation times can be extraordinary. |

# Hiring Without Whiteboards

A list of companies (or teams) that don't do "whiteboard" interviews. "Whiteboards" is used as a metaphor, and is a _symbol_ for the kinds of CS trivia questions that are associated with bad interview practices. Whiteboards are not bad – CS trivia questions are. Using sites like HackerRank/LeetCode _probably_ fall into a similar category.

The companies and teams listed here use interview techniques and questions that resemble day-to-day work. For example, pairing on a real world problem or a paid/unpaid take home exercise. Read (and contribute to) [our recommendations](RECOMMENDATIONS.md) for ways to conduct better interviews.

### tl;dr
- Discussing a real world problem (with or without whiteboard) is 👍
- Solving CS trivia, technical puzzles, riddles, brainteasers (with or without whiteboard) is 👎

Please open a [PR](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/pull/new/master) to be added.

### Duds

If you've been through an interview with one of these companies recently, and your experience suggests otherwise from their description, please open a [PR](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/pull/new/master) to remove them from this list.

  algorithm?
* What is [*sequential consistency*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_consistency)? (The result of any execution is the same as if the operations of all the processors were executed in some sequential order, and the operations of each individual processor appear in this sequence in the order specified by its program).
* What is a [*memory barrier*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_barrier)? (A memory barrier, also known as a membar, memory fence or fence instruction, is a type of barrier instruction that causes a CPU or compiler to enforce an ordering constraint on memory operations issued before and after the barrier instruction)

  * CountDownLatch
  * CyclicBarrier
  * Phaser
  * ReentrantLock
  * Exchanger

(When a program contains two conflicting accesses that are not ordered by a [happens-before](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se12/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4.5) relationship, it is said to contain a data race. Two accesses to (reads of or writes to) the same variable are said to be conflicting if at least one of the accesses is a write. But see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16615140/is-volatile-read-happens-before-volatile-write/16615355#16615355))

  * A program is correctly synchronized if and only if all sequentially consistent executions are free of data races
  * Correctly synchronized programs have sequentially consistent semantics. If a program is correctly synchronized, then all executions of the program will appear to be sequentially consistent
  * Causality requirement for incorrectly synchronized programs: [link](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c132/11697f5c803221533a07bd6db839fa60b7b8.pdf)

### [Practice/ES6/Destructuring_Geneal.md](Practice/ES6/Destructuring_Geneal.md)
### General Object Destructuring Example

```js
let myObj = {
    name: "Luke",
    age: 25,
    hobbies: "music"
};

let { name, age, hobbies } = myObj;

console.log(name, age, hobbies);    // => Luke 25 music
```

Now the variables listed in between the curly braces are assigned the value of their respective properties in myObj.

### The order in which the variables are listed in the curly braces doesn't matter. Additionally, we don't have to list all the properties of an object if we only need one or two.

```js
console.log(age, name, hobbies);    // => 25 'Luke' 'music'

console.log(hobbies, name, age);    // => music Luke 25

console.log(hobbies, name);    // => music Luke

```

### General Array Destructuring Example

```js
let arr = ['Jim', 'Bob', 'Sarah', 'Cassie'];

let [ jim, bob, sarah, cassie ] = arr;

console.log(jim, bob, sarah, cassie); //outputs: Jim Bob Sarah Cassie
```

## Unlike objects, the name we give the variables doesn't matter. Let's change the above example:  So, each of the variable names will ONLY count for the index-positions I fetch.

```js
let arr = ['Jim', 'Bob', 'Sarah', 'Cassie'];

let [ var1, var2, var3, var4] = arr;

console.log(var1, var2, var3, var4); //outputs: Jim Bob Sarah Cassie
```

### If I include less variables then there are indexes in the arrays, then just like in Object-destructuring, only that many array element will be included in the returned array, starting from zero-index position and AGAIN without giving any meaning to the the name I give to the variables. So, each of the variable names will ONLY count for the index-positions I fetch.

let arr = ['Jim', 'Bob', 'Sarah', 'Cassie'];

let [ jim, bob, cassie ] = arr;

console.log(jim, bob, cassie); //outputs: Jim Bob Sarah

## Using Spread operator -  It is often used for splitting out a part of an object, but keeping the remaining properties in another object.

```js
let myObj = {

    name: "Luke",
    age: 25,
    hobbies: "music"

};

let { hobbies, ...rest } = myObj;  // => Luke 25 music

console.log(hobbies, rest)  // => music { name: 'Luke', age: 25 }

console.log(hobbies, rest.age)  // => music 25

```

# How .then() actually makes few asynchronous calls happen in particular order one after another

A> https://spring.io/understanding/javascript-promises

A function passed to then can also return another promise. This allows asynchronous operations to be chained together, so that they are guaranteed to happen in the correct order.

B> https://medium.com/codebuddies/getting-to-know-asynchronous-javascript-callbacks-promises-and-async-await-17e0673281ee

The true power of promises is shown when you have several asynchronous operations that depend on each other. So let's take the case where we have to make a request that depends on the result of another request.

## Callback Hell Example
Callbacks are a good way to declare what will happen once an I/O operation has a result, but what if you want to use that data in order to make another request? You can only handle the result of the request (if we use the example above) within the callback function provided.

```js
let request = require('request');

let result;

request('http://www.google.com', (error, response, body) => {
    if (error) {
        // Handle error
    } else {
        result = body;
        console.log("Request successful")
    }
})

console.log(result);

/* OUTPUT

undefined
Request successful
*/
```
In this example above, the variable “result" will not have a value when printed to the console at the last line. And will output “undefined" to the console because at the time that line is being executed, the callback has not been called. Even if the request were somehow to complete before the result variable is printed to the console (which is almost impossible as though, as inside the callback I am making a network request to google.com server), this code will still run to completion before the callback is executed anyway because that is the nature of the non-blocking I/O model in JavaScript.

## Because, by the non-blocking architecture, of JS / Node, while the callback is being executed ( making a request to google.com in this case) - the rest of the code after the callback function's block will continue to get executed.

``( See my explanation in - Asynchronous-Non-blocking-Mechanism-in-Node.md)``

So if we want to do a second request based on the result of a first one we have to do it inside the callback function of the first request because that is where the result will be available:
```js
let request = require('request');

let result;

request('http://www.google.com', function (firstError, firstResponse, firstBody) {
    if(firstError){
        // Handle error.
    }
    else {
        request(`https://www.facebook.com`, function (secondError, secondResponse, secondBody) {
            if(secondError){
                // Handle error.
            }
            else {
                result = secondBody;
                console.log('successfully hit facebook server')
            }
        });
    }
});

console.log(result);

/* OUTPUT

undefined
successfully hit facebook server
*/

```
One thing to note here is the first argument in every callback function will contain an error if something went wrong, or will be empty if all went well. This pattern is called “error first callbacks" and is very common. It is the standard pattern for callback-based APIs in NodeJs. This means that for every callback declared we need to check if there is an error and that just adds to the mess when dealing with nested callbacks.

This is the anti-pattern that has been named “callback hell".


### A promise is an object that wraps an asynchronous operation and notifies when it's done. This sounds exactly like callbacks, but the important differences are in the usage of Promises. Instead of providing a callback, a promise has its own methods (.then) which you call to tell the promise what will happen when it is successful or when it fails. The methods a promise provides are “then(…)" for when a successful result is available and “catch(…)" for when something went wrong.

Below is general syntax

```js
someAsyncOperation(someParams)
.then(function(result){
    // Do something with the result
})
.catch(function(error){
    // Handle error
});

```

So, handle the above case with Promise I am using “axios" that is similar to “request" package but it uses promises instead of callbacks.

```js
const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('http://www.somepage.com')
.then(function (response) {
    // response being the result of the first request
    // Returns another promise to the next .then(..) in the chain
    return axios.get(`http://www.somepage.com/${response.someValue}`);
})
.then(function response {
    // response being the result of the second request
    // Handle response
})
.catch(function (error) {
    // Handle error.
});

```

Instead of nesting callbacks inside callbacks inside callbacks, you chain .then() calls together making it more readable and easier to follow. Every .then() should either return a new Promise or just a value or object which will be passed to the next .then() in the chain. Another important thing to notice is that even though we are doing two different asynchronous requests we only have one .catch() where we handle our errors. That's because any error that occurs in the Promise chain will stop further execution and an error will end up in the next .catch() in the chain.

A friendly reminder: just like with callback based APIs, this is still asynchronous operations. The code that is executed when the request has finished — that is, the subsequent .then() calls — is put on the event loop just like a callback function would be. This means you cannot access any variables passed to or declared in the Promise chain outside the Promise. The same goes for errors thrown in the Promise chain.


### As a side note, remember the general syntax of chaining together axios calls

```JS
axios.get('http://google.com')
    .then((response) => {
        // do something with Google res
        return axios.get('http://apple.com')
        // response being the result of the first request
        // do something with Apple res
    })
    .catch((err) => {
        // handle err
    })

# jQuery

> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.

For information on how to get started and how to use jQuery, please see [jQuery's documentation](https://api.jquery.com/).
For source files and issues, please visit the [jQuery repo](https://github.com/jquery/jquery).

If upgrading, please see the [blog post for 3.5.1](https://blog.jquery.com/2020/05/04/jquery-3-5-1-released-fixing-a-regression/). This includes notable differences from the previous version and a more readable changelog.

## Including jQuery

Below are some of the most common ways to include jQuery.

### Browser

#### Script tag

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
```

#### Babel

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is a next generation JavaScript compiler. One of the features is the ability to use ES6/ES2015 modules now, even though browsers do not yet support this feature natively.

```js
import $ from "jquery";
```

#### Browserify/Webpack

There are several ways to use [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). For more information on using these tools, please refer to the corresponding project's documentation. In the script, including jQuery will usually look like this...

```js
var $ = require( "jquery" );
```

#### AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition)

AMD is a module format built for the browser. For more information, we recommend [require.js' documentation](https://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html).

```js
define( [ "jquery" ], function( $ ) {

} );
```

### Node

To include jQuery in [Node](https://nodejs.org/), first install with npm.

```sh
npm install jquery
```

For jQuery to work in Node, a window with a document is required. Since no such window exists natively in Node, one can be mocked by tools such as [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom). This can be useful for testing purposes.

```js
const { JSDOM } = require( "jsdom" );
const { window } = new JSDOM( "" );
const $ = require( "jquery" )( window );
```
