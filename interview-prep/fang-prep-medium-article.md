## Summary <a href="03ef" id="03ef"></a>

If you complete all questions and looking for more problem sets, I recommend checking out [Algorithm Questions](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/tree/master/algorithms). They also summarize LeetCode problems by category.

If you finish Algorithm Questions too, check out [Algorithms and Coding Interviews](https://github.com/liyin2015/Algorithms-and-Coding-Interviews/blob/master/Preparing\_for\_the\_real-world\_software\_engineering.pdf). My friend is writing it, and it’s worth to read. It provides more detail explanation and general approaches to the problems.

I mentioned these links in the middle of the stories, but here are links to keep track of your progress. Feel free to use them!
