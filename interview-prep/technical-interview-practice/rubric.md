Student understands that viewport metatag needs to be in head for mobile browser to read media queries. Student consistently and appropriately uses responsive units (rem %, vh, vw) and can justify why and where they use them.                                                                                                                                                                                               | Student uses max width, min width, and responsive units correctly.

Student can give examples of how semantic html tags are useful for any disadvantaged group (blind, low-connectivity areas). Student explains or attempts to explain how to make forms and images accessible and understands the importance of doing so. Student can explain why accessibility matters from both a business AND personal standpoint.                                                                                                                                        | Student can define semantic HTML as tags that have english meaning (may not use the term 'semantic HTML' and that's ok). Student similarly understands that semantic HTML is important for accessibility. Student can explain the use of alt tags for images, explains that structuring HTML is important Student can explain why accessibility matters from either a business OR personal standpoint.                                          | Student can't define semantic HTML.

Student defines higher order function, callback functions and explains similarities between the two in terms of functionality and returns. Student can define callback as a function that can be passed into another function as a parameter and clearly distinguishes between an argument and a parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Student identifies the higher order function that takes three paramaters where at least one is a callback.

Student can define callback as the function that gets passed into a higher order function and higher order function as recieving other functions as parameters.                                                                                                                         | Student cannot distinguish between higher order function and callbacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Brit's class on this topic [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPrDfOaG6W4\&amp=\&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPrDfOaG6W4&amp=&feature=youtu.be) and the codepen solution for that recording is here: [https://codepen.io/BritHemming/pen/LYVgjxg?editors=0010](https://codepen.io/BritHemming/pen/LYVgjxg?editors=0010) |
