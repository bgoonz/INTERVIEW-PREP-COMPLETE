## [88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/)

### Problem:

Given two sorted integer arrays _nums1_ and _nums2_, merge _nums2_ into _nums1_ as one sorted array.

**Note:**

- The number of elements initialized in _nums1_ and _nums2_ are _m_ and _n_ respectively.
- You may assume that _nums1_ has enough space (size that is greater or equal to _m_ + _n_) to hold additional elements from _nums2_.

**Example:**

```
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

### Solution:

Loop backward and keep picking the larger one. `nums1` is guaranteed longer than `nums2` so just use `n` as boundary.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums1
 * @param {number} m
 * @param {number[]} nums2
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
 */
var merge = function (nums1, m, nums2, n) {
  let len = m-- + n--;
  while (n >= 0) {
    nums1[--len] = nums1[m] >= nums2[n] ? nums1[m--] : nums2[n--];
  }
};
```
