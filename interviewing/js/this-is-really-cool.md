# This is really cool!

This is really cool! I don't have the time to read it thoroughly right now but I've bookmarked it so that I will later... This includes a lot of the feature extraction techniques I considered in my college capstone project. It was an automated guitar effects triggering platform that would track the progress of a live performance and use an algorithm called dynamic time warping to determine when it was the appropriate time in the song to change the effects/settings. This repo is not optimized for readability but I'll link it incase you have any interest.
