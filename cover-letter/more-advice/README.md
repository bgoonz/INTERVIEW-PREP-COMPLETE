To write a great Web Developer cover letter, you will want to:

3. Describe notable achievements and accomplishments
4. Show enthusiasm for the company and explain why you are applying to the Web Developer position
5. End the letter professionally and encourage the Hiring Manager to contact you

There are also a few best practices to keep in mind when writing a cover letter:

* **Customize your message**. Different Web Developer positions will require different technical skills or experiences. Each cover letter you submit should emphasize your qualifications as they relate to the specific role.
* **Highlight the right skills**. The Web Developer skills you include should match the skills listed in the job description. Highlight both your technical skills, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as soft skills, like communication and problem-solving.
* **Quantify your accomplishments**. Where possible, back up your successes with facts and data to show the impact of your work as a Web Developer.

* **Research the company**. Learn more about the company’s work and products. Tailor your cover letter to their needs. This will show employers that you are prepared and enthusiastic.
* **Keep it concise**. Include only the most important and relevant information. Generally, a Web Developer cover letter should only be around 200-300 words.
* **Edit and proofread**. Always review your writing before submitting it. A cover letter is your first impression, so check carefully for any spelling and grammar mistakes.
