**Subject:** Summer Internship

Dear BLOCKED

My name is (BLOCKED) and I am an undergraduate finance student at (BLOCKED). I met you the summer before last at Smith & Wollensky’s in New York when I was touring the east coast with my uncle, (BLOCKED). I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to talk with me that night.

I am writing to inquire about a possible summer internship in your office.  **I** **am aware it is highly unusual for undergraduates from average universities like (BLOCKED) to intern at (BLOCKED), but nevertheless I was hoping you might make an exception.**  I am extremely interested in investment banking and would love nothing more than to learn under your tutelage**. **I have no qualms about fetching coffee, shining shoes or picking up laundry, and will work for next to nothing. In all honesty, I just want to be around professionals in the industry and gain as much knowledge as I can.

**I won’t waste your time inflating my credentials, throwing around exaggerated job titles**, or feeding you a line of crapp (sic) about how my past experiences and skill set align perfectly for an investment banking internship.  **The truth is I have no unbelievably special skills or genius eccentricities, **but I do have a near perfect GPA and will work hard for you.  I’ve interned for [Merrill Lynch](http://blogs.forbes.com/merrilllynch/) in the Wealth Management Division and taken an investment banking class at (BLOCKED), for whatever that is worth.

I am currently awaiting admission results for (BLOCKED) Masters of Science in Accountancy program, which I would begin this fall if admitted. I am also planning on attending law school after my master’s program, which we spoke about in New York. I apologize for the blunt nature of my letter, but I hope you seriously consider taking me under your wing this summer. I have attached my resume for your review. Feel free to call me at (BLOCKED) or email at (BLOCKED). Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

BLOCKED.
