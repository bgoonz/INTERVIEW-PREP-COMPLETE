**What are cover letters and why write them?**

A cover letter is a document you include with your application materials, typically the first page, that provides a brief overview of your background, interest in the position, experience,and  relevant skills. Think of them as a “first impression.” Good ones offer a synthesis of your qualifications and entice hiring managers to read your application in further detail. Bad ones send your application straight to the trash bin. Think of them as a professional advertisement for your job candidacy.&#x20;

Ultimately, cover letters should address two questions:

1. Why are you the right person for the job?
2. How will you add value to the company?

**Characteristics of a great cover letter**

A cover letter does more than just list relevant information. Effective cover letters are succinct, well-organized, and engaging. Even the most qualified applications may not be able to overcome a bad cover letter. So what makes a great one? Here are some derived from the career center at [Harvard](https://ocs.fas.harvard.edu/files/ocs/files/hes-resume-cover-letter-guide.pdf).&#x20;

* NO MORE THAN ONE PAGE: Keep your letters concise, succinct and factual. Now isn’t the time to wax poetic about all of your unique characteristics.&#x20;
* Address your letter to a specific person--the hiring manager, preferably.
* Research the company you’re applying to and tailor your letter accordingly.&#x20;
* Make sure each skill comes with an example. Remember, claims need proof.
* Think like the reader. Would you interview you? If not, you need to keep working on your letter.
* Sell yourself with action verbs
* Speak to the job description. Make clear how you fit each of the criteria listed.
* Be consistent. Make sure your letter uses the same font as the rest of your materials, especially your resume.&#x20;

**Cover letter structures**

Cover letters should be well organized and visually appealing. Keeping it simple is the easiest way to do this.&#x20;

Your letter should begin with your contact information, company nickname, and salutation (“Dear…”)

The rest of your letter should consist of three paragraphs.&#x20;

1. The opening paragraph should identify who you are, state why you are writing, name the position you are applying for, and explain (in one sentence) why you’re uniquely qualified for the position.
2. Next, elaborate on your interest and qualifications. Be careful not to spend too much time recounting your background; that’s what your resume is for. Stay focused on skills and brief examples.&#x20;
3. To close, reiterate your interest in and enthusiasm for the position. Thank your reader for considering you, and state your hope for an opportunity to discuss the position further.&#x20;

All that’s left is to end your letter with a “Sincerely, \[your name]”
