Your database is an RDS instance running SQL Server with Multi-AZ replication and you have several older .NET console utilities that perform database operations every 15 seconds. When the cluster has to switch the primary database server to the secondary AZ, the .NET utilities start to report connection failures to the database although other applications are able to access the database. How do you correct this problem?</h4>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Use the RDS console to force a reboot of the database instance so that the primary server becomes the master server again.</li>
<li>[ ] The server running the .NET utilities is caching the DNS lookup on the database cluster address. Flush the DNS cache of the server and force the C# utilities to open new connections to the database.</li>
<li>[ ] A.NET application will retain the IP address of a connection string until the host machine is rebooted.</li>
<li>[x] The NET utilities need to change the SQL Server endpoint in the connection strings to read from the secondary database server using a try/catch.</li>

<ul>
<li>[ ] All images in the AWS Marketplace incur additional hourly fees in addition to the charges from the instance size you select.</li>
<li>[ ] You can only launch images that were created by other users on your AWS account, so you pay only for the instance size you select and the S3 storage costs for the base image.</li>
<li>[x] Each image has its own pricing that could either be free, or include charges for software licensing costs. You will also pay for the instance the image runs on</li>
<li>[ ] All images in the AWS Marketplace contain only open-source software with no additional fees and are created by other AWS users. You will pay only for the instance size you select.</li>

You created a Windows EC2 instance with a public IP address and installed SQL Server. When attempting to connect to SQL Server from SQL Server Enterprise Manager on your local computer, the Windows EC2 instance is unable to establish a connection to the server. What is the first thing you should check?</h4>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Check the routing tables for the VPC.</li>
<li>[x] Verify that the assigned security groups allow TCP port 1433 traffic from your current IP address.</li>
<li>[ ] Check the policies within Windows Firewall</li>
<li>[ ] Verify that you are connecting to the instance using a user that is not sa.</li>

You are hosting an application configured to stream media to its clients on TCP ports 3380-3384, 3386-3388, and 3390. The Inbound tab below shows three incoming security group policies attached to this instance. Which policy should you use?</h4>
<ul>
<li>[ ] The rule that exposes TCP ports 3380-3390 would also publicly expose port 3389 (RDP) to the entire internet. Write separate rules to only expose the needed ports.</li>
<li>[ ] The first security group rule allows all traffic into this instance. Exposing your entire instance to the whole internet leaves the server open to various attacks of the other services running on different port numbers.</li>
<li>[ ] Verify that the AWS account owners actually control the entire CIDR C block for 12.228.11.0-255 and these are secured IPs for RDP access into this instance.</li>
<li>[ ] There are no recommendations to make.</li>

You have four front-end web servers behind a load balancer, which use NFS to access another EC2 instance that resizes and stores images for the front-end application. What security group policies should be assigned to these servers?</h4>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Assign Elastic IPs to all of the instances and create a group that allows all traffic to pass between each of the five Elastic IP addresses and allow all inbound HTTPS traffic.</li>
<li>[x] Front-end web servers should allow HTTPS. Assign another group to all of the instances that allows all traffic to pass between instances using that group.</li>
<li>[ ] Create a security group that allows inbound NFS, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic from all IP addresses. Apply this group to all of the servers.</li>
<li>[ ] Create a security group that allows inbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic from all IP addresses and apply this to the web servers. Create a second security group for the NFS filestore that allows outbound NFS traffic to the private IP range of the front-end web servers.</li>

You have a Linux EC2 web server that suddenly is timing out on all HTTP requests and your SSH connection attempts are timing out. You notice that it is failing the system status check in the EC2 console. What action should you take?</h4>
<ul>
<li>[х] Restore the instance from the last AMI image. System status checks indicate that the filesystem on the instance is corrupted.</li>
<li>[ ] Stop and start the instance. This will move the instance to another host.</li>
<li>[ ] Contact AWS support. Failing a system status check indicates a failure in the underlying hardware and must be addressed by an AWS representative.</li>
<li>[ ] Reboot the instance. This will stop and start the instance and move it to another host.</li>

You have several on-premise servers and would like to store your offsite backups on AWS. What fully managed backup service can you use to ship your backups to AWS?</h4>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Windows Server 2016 supports S3 as a target when using storage replicas.</li>
<li>[х] Use Storage Gateway.</li>
<li>[ ] Sync files directly to S3 with the AWS CLI.</li>
<li>[ ] Use the RDS console to force a reboot of the database instance so that the primary server becomes the master server again.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="q26.-what-is-the-best-practice-for-creating-a-highly-available-postgresql-database-in-rds-that-can-sustain-the-loss-of-a-single-aws-region">Q26. What is the best practice for creating a highly available PostgreSQL database in RDS that can sustain the loss of a single AWS region?</h4>
<ul>
<li>[ ] PostgreSQL cannot be replicated across regions. Restore the database backups from an S3 bucket and repoint your database connections to the new instance.</li>
<li>[х] Create Read Replicas in other AWS regions. You can designate a new master database from any of the read replicas until the regional failure is resolved.</li>
<li>[ ] Verify that your instance is configured for Multi-AZ support. Database changes will be automatically synced to another region in the event of a failure and RDS will automatically select a new master until the regional failure is resolved.</li>
<li>[ ] Create Read Replicas in other AWS regions. Ensure read operations against the database occur on an available Read Replica, and send write operations to another region if you need to promote a Read Replica to a standalone database if the master is down.</li>

You created a new Linux EC2 instance and installed PostgreSQL but you are not able to establish a connection to the server from your local computer. What steps do you take to resolve this issue?</h4>
<ul>
<li>[x] Create a security group rule that allows all traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. This will verify whether or not another rule is denying the traffic.</li>
<li>[ ] Verify that the assigned security groups allow traffic from your IP address to port 5432. Verify that PostgreSQL is configured to listen to external traffic and is bound to the public interface.</li>
<li>[ ] Make sure that you are using an Elastic IP and that it is included within the <code>postgresql.conf</code> configuration file.</li>
<li>[ ] Stop and start the instance. New security group rules will only take effect after a restart.</li>
