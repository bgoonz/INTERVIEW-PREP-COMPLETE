      </center>
      <p>
        Your resume is your personal summary sheet. Your resume is the thing
        that gets your foot in the door. So, there's a few things you should do
        (and not do) to make it as awesome as you are.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mume-header" id="make-your-name-big">
        Make your name <strong>BIG.</strong>
      </h3>

      <p>
        Your name has to stand out from everything else, because you want it to
        be remembered. Making it the biggest thing on the page is the easiest
        thing you can do to make that possible. I've seen soooo many resumes
        where the name is at the top, but it's just bolded and centered and they
        expect that to be enough. It's not.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mume-header" id="remove-the-objective">
        Remove the objective.
      </h3>

      <p>
        Nobody looks at the objective. Nobody. I personally spoke to a bunch of
        recruiters from various companies and they all said that they never look
        at them. Use that space to talk about projects you've done, activities
        you've done, etc.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mume-header" id="keep-it-to-a-single-page">
        Keep it to a single page.
      </h3>

      <p>
        Recruiters are looking for a short summary of you. They're reading
        several resumes a day, and if they see something longer than they
        typically read, they could pass over yours for something more concise!
        If you'd like to say more, put a link to a personal website or portfolio
        for someone to find it. A resume is a summary, not a tome.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mume-header" id="remove-irrelevant-information">
        Remove irrelevant information.
      </h3>

      <p>
        I know that lifeguarding in high school was a good gig that helped you
        gain people skills and attention to detail. But you're in tech. That
        doesn't matter as much to tech companies. Sorry, buddy. I still think
        you're great with people.<br />
        When you're a first semester freshman, it's okay to have old high school
        stuff on there, just because it's less likely that you have other things
        to put on your resume. But as soon as you have a college GPA to work
        with, a club or two, and some volunteer experiences to replace that, do
        it.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mume-header" id="dont-make-it-a-scavenger-hunt">
        Don't make it a scavenger hunt.
      </h3>

      <p>
        When an application reviewer (engineer, recruiter, or otherwise) is
        looking over your resume, don't make it difficult for them to understand
        who you are and what you know.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you have online profiles like GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter,
        or even your own personal website, put it on your resume. Don't make
        them have to search long and hard for you online if they want to know
        more!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you decide to put relevant coursework on your resume,
        <strong>please</strong>, don't just put course numbers. Nobody knows
        what that means. And nobody is going to go to your university's website
        to find out exactly what CS229 is. Put down the course titles instead!
      </p>
      <p>
        And finally, put down your graduation date. So many students I've seen
        don't put it on there because they are hiding the fact that they're a
        freshman, or they're "technically a junior if you count the credits."
        That doesn't matter. Trust me. Just put down your graduation date so
        that the company knows how much experience you have, and how soon they
        can potentially pull you in for full-time.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mume-header" id="include-only-certain-personal-information">
        Include only certain personal information.
      </h3>

      <p>
        Companies aren't allowed to ask about your religion, marital status, or
        race/ethnicity, so you shouldn't include that.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of contact information: you don't need your mailing address.
        That is a thing of the past. Just like my youth. Tech companies email,
        and <strong>maybe</strong> call. That's all you need!<br />
        Some great things that you might also want to put on there are your
        personal website (if you have one, which you should), your GitHub
        profile (if you have one, which you should), and your LinkedIn (if you
        have one, which you should).
      </p>
      <h1 class="mume-header" id="cv-sample">CV Sample</h1>

      <p>
        Your cover letter is your written sales pitch. You've got a resume that
        summarizes everything. Now you have to write out a more complete,
        professional description of you and what you can offer a given company.
        Here's a sample cover letter to get you started:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Dear _________,</p>
        <p>
          I hope your day is going well! My name is _________, and I'm a
          _________ at _________. I am very interested in working for _________
          next _________. Your commitment to _________ and _________ that I saw
          on the website inspired me! The products you build and the values you
          stand for make _________ seem like an ideal workplace for me. A little
          about me, I [insert relevant work experience, extracurriculars, and
          projects here]. I think these experiences would make me a great
          candidate for you.<br />
          Please let me know if there's anything else you need from me. I look
          forward to hearing from you! I can be reached at _________ and
          _________<br />
          Best regards,
        </p>
        <hr />
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Now, remember, this is just a sample. You can write a cover letter in
        any format you'd like. But, you should be sure to include the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Who</strong> - Who you are. Easy enough.</li>
        <li><strong>Where</strong> - Where you're coming from.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Why</strong> - Why you're interested in this company, and show
          that you researched them.
        </li>
        <li><strong>What</strong> - What you can bring to the table.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>When</strong> - When you're available to start, and when they
          can contact you.
        </li>
        <li><strong>How</strong> - How they can reach you.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1 class="mume-header" id="your-attitude">Your Attitude</h1>

      <p>
        When you're internship/job hunting, it's very easy to feel down if you
        don't hear back from companies, an interview goes poorly, or you start
        comparing yourself to people. It's a tough field we're going into.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to emphasize something: <strong>You're brilliant.</strong> You're
        in this field for a reason. When your grades aren't awesome or someone
        gets something that you wanted, don't feel down on yourself. So many
        opportunities will come your way if you just keep working hard and
        refining your skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mark Twain once said, "Comparison is the death of joy." When you start
        to compare your skills to others, it's hard to not feel as good about
        your own, or to get a little too competitive about your work. Work hard
        and don't let others get you down. It's remarkable how significantly
        that can improve both your work and your interviewing experience!
      </p>
      <p>
        When you're talking to companies and recruiters at career fairs and
        hackathons and over the phone, be confident, not arrogant. Be grateful
        for the opportunity they're giving you, and smile! A great attitude will
        take you VERY far.
      </p>
      <h1 class="mume-header" id="your-skills">Your Skills</h1>

      <p>
        Obviously, your skills are what a company is buying from you when they
        hire you. So, honing in those skills and presenting them in an effective
        way is <em>probably</em> the most important thing in getting a gig.

        Chances are, if you've had a data structures and/or algorithms class,
        you're already going to do pretty well in the technical interviews. That
        is, if you can recall the information you learned.

        Typically, for an internship or your first job, questions won't get much
        more specific unless you're applying for a specific role. For example,
        if I wanted to be a mobile intern, I might be asked iOS/Android/Windows
        Phone specific questions, or if I wanted to be a web intern, I might be
        asked HTML/CSS/JavaScript questions, or if I wanted to be a backend
        intern, I might be asked about Django or Node or Ruby on Rails. That
        definitely depends on the company, and what you're both looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure you're able to implement and use the above data structures
        without the assistance of an IDE. Typically, onsite technical interviews
        involve coding on paper or a whiteboard, and phone/video interviews
        usually involve some kind of collaborative text editor. Yes, that means
        you won't have access to auto-complete, auto-compiling, or the internet
        to check for errors. So be ready for that!
      </p>
      <h2 class="mume-header" id="selling-them">Selling Them</h2>

      <p>
        When you're actively emailing and speaking with recruiters, they're
        going to ask you a lot of questions that are just checkboxes for what
        they're looking for in terms of skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've written anything in a language before,
        <strong>put it on your resume</strong>. A lot of companies have parsers
        that look for specific things that, again, will put a tick on those
        checkboxes before putting you through to the next round of review. Now,
        if you've only ever done "Hello, world!" in Python, don't say that
        you're a Python ninja or whatever. You don't want to be thrown into an
        interview that will only hurt your self-confidence. Speaking from
        experience. Trust me.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a recruiter or engineer is asking you about a certain project
        you've done, or how you've used a particular language, be as specific as
        possible. Tell them <strong>exactly</strong> what you did on that
        particular project (or internship or what have you). Tell them how much
        you contributed, what languages you used, how long was the duration of
        development for that project, what was the outcome of the project, etc.
        etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, don't say, "I'm the webmaster for a club website. Next
        question." Okay, Dwight Schrute. Go back to your beet farm. Instead, say
        something more like this: "I developed and currently maintain the
        website for my university's computer science club. I built it from the
        ground up with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery on the front-end. It's
        a static site, so a backend wasn't needed. The website's main function
        is to promote the club and give members crucial updates about meetings
        and events, and I update it regularly via a Python script I wrote." Oh
        my, you enchanting software engineer, you. Let me hire you.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you're talking to companies about specific things you've done, make
        sure they know:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>What?</strong> - What? - What did you make? What does it do?
          What impact has it made? What was the hardest part? What could you
          have done better?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Why?</strong> - Why did you make it? Was it for a hackathon, a
          school project, an open source contribution, or something else?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How?</strong> - With which technologies did you make this? Did
          you use a specific API? What parts of it did you work on?

        Asymptotic Notation is the hardware independent notation used to tell
        the time and space complexity of an algorithm. Meaning it's a
        standardized way of measuring how much memory an algorithm uses or how
        long it runs for given an input.

        Big-O refers to the upper bound of time or space complexity of an
        algorithm, meaning it worst case runtime scenario. An easy way to think
        of it is that runtime could be better than Big-O but it will never be
        worse.

      <p>
        Big-Omega refers to the lower bound of time or space complexity of an
        algorithm, meaning it is the best runtime scenario. Or runtime could
        worse than Big-Omega, but it will never be better.

      </h3>

      <p>
        Big-Theta refers to the tight bound of time or space complexity of an
        algorithm. Another way to think of it is the intersection of Big-O and
        Big-Omega, or more simply runtime is guaranteed to be a given
        complexity, such as <code>n log n</code> .

        <span style="color: red"> What you need to know</span>
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Big-O and Big-Theta are the most common and helpful notations</li>
        <li>
          Big-O does <em>not</em> mean Worst Case Scenario, Big-Theta does
          <em>not</em> mean average case, and Big-Omega does <em>not</em> mean
          Best Case Scenario. They only connote the algorithm's performance for
          a particular scenario, and all three can be used for any scenario.
        </li>
        <li>
          Worst Case means given an unideal input, Average Case means given a
          typical input, Best case means a ideal input. Ex. Worst case means
          given an input the algorithm performs particularly bad, or best case
          an already sorted array for a sorting algorithm.
        </li>
        <li>
          Best Case and Big Omega are generally not helpful since Best Cases are
          rare in the real world and lower bound might be very different than an
          upper bound.
        </li>
        <li>
          Big-O isn't everything. On paper merge sort is faster than quick sort,
          but in practice quick sort is superior.

            <li>
              If the cursor is smaller than the item on the left it swaps

            <li>

      <p>
        ARIA stands for "Accessible Rich Internet Applications", and is a
        technical specification created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
        Better known as WAI-ARIA, it provides additional HTML attributes in the
        development of web applications to offer people who use assistive
        technologies (AT) a more robust and interoperable experience with
        dynamic components. By providing the component's role, name, and state,
        AT users can better understand how to interact with the component.
        WAI-ARIA should only be used when an HTML element equivalent is not
        available or lacks full browser or AT support. WAI-ARIA's semantic
        markup coupled with JavaScript works to provide an understandable and
        interactive experience for people who use AT.<br />
        An example using ARIA:
      </p>
      <pre class="language-text">
&lt;div 
  role="combobox"
  aria-expanded="false"
  aria-owns="ex1-grid"
  aria-haspopup="grid"
  id="ex1-combobox"&gt;
  ...
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre

      <p>
        There are multiple tools that can help you to find for accessibility
        issues in your website or application.<br />
        Check for issues in your website:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lighthouse from Google, it provides an option for accessibility
          testing, it will check for the compliance of different accessibility
          standards and give you an score with details on the different issues
        </li>
        <li>
          Axe Coconut from DequeLabs, it is a Chrome extension that adds a tab
          in the Developer tools, it will check for accessibility issues and it
          will classify them by severity and suggest possible solutions
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Check for issues in your code: * Jest Axe, you can add unit tests for
        accessibility * React Axe, test your React application with the axe-core
        accessibility testing library. Results will show in the Chrome DevTools
        console. * eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, pairing this plugin with an editor
        lint plugin, you can bake accessibility standards into your application
        in real-time.<br />
        Check for individual issues: * Color Contrast checkers * Use a screen
        reader * Use only keyboard to navigate your site

      <p>
        The Accessibility Tree is a structure produced by the browser's
        Accessibility APIs which provides accessibility information to assistive
        technologies such as screen readers. It runs parallel to the DOM and is
        similar to the DOM API, but with much fewer nodes, because a lot of that
        information is only useful for visual presentation. By writing semantic
        HTML we can take advantage of this process in creating an accessible
        experience for our users.

      <p>
        The <code>alt</code> attribute provides alternative information for an
        image if a user cannot view it. The <code>alt</code> attribute should be
        used to describe any images except those which only serve a decorative
        purpose, in which case it should be left empty.

          Decorative images should have an empty <code>alt</code> attribute.

        If neither attribute is present, the script is downloaded and executed
        synchronously, and will halt parsing of the document until it has
        finished executing (default behavior). Scripts are downloaded and
        executed in the order they are encountered.<br />
        The <code>defer</code> attribute downloads the script while the document
        is still parsing but waits until the document has finished parsing
        before executing it, equivalent to executing inside a
        <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event listener. <code>defer</code> scripts
        will execute in order.<br />
        The <code>async</code> attribute downloads the script during parsing the
        document but will pause the parser to execute the script before it has
        fully finished parsing. <code>async</code> scripts will not necessarily
        execute in order.<br />
        Note: both attributes must only be used if the script has a
        <code>src</code> attribute (i.e.&nbsp;not an inline script).

          Placing a <code>defer</code> script in the
          <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> allows the browser to download the script
          while the page is still parsing, and is therefore a better option than
          placing the script before the end of the body.

      <p>
        An <code>async</code> function is a function that allows you to pause
        the function's execution while it waits for ( <code>await</code> s) a
        promise to resolve. It's an abstraction on top of the Promise API that
        makes asynchronous operations <em>look</em> like they're synchronous.<br />
        <code>async</code> functions automatically return a Promise object.
        Whatever you <code>return</code> from the <code>async</code> function
        will be the promise's <em>resolution</em>. If instead you
        <code>throw</code> from the body of an <code>async</code> function, that
        will be how your async function <em>rejects</em> the promise it
        returns.<br />
        Most importantly, <code>async</code> functions are able to use the
        <code>await</code> keyword in their function body, which
        <strong>pauses the function</strong> until the operation after the
        <code>await</code> completes, and allows it to return that operation's
        result to a variable synchronously.

        We must have all ingredients of the recipe available, and in quantities
        that are more than or equal to the number of units required. If just one
        of the ingredients is not available or lower than needed, we cannot make
        a single batch.<br />
        Use <code>Object.keys()</code> to return the ingredients of the recipe
        as an array, then use <code>Array.prototype.map()</code> to map each
        ingredient to the ratio of available units to the amount required by the
        recipe. If one of the ingredients required by the recipe is not
        available at all, the ratio will evaluate to <code>NaN</code> , so the
        logical OR operator can be used to fallback to <code>0</code> in this
        case.<br />
        Use the spread <code>...</code> operator to feed the array of all the
        ingredient ratios into <code>Math.min()</code> to determine the lowest
        ratio. Passing this entire result into <code>Math.floor()</code> rounds
        down to return the maximum number of whole batches.

      <p>
        The BEM methodology is a naming convention for CSS classes in order to
        keep CSS more maintainable by defining namespaces to solve scoping
        issues. BEM stands for Block Element Modifier which is an explanation
        for its structure. A Block is a standalone component that is reusable
        across projects and acts as a "namespace" for sub components (Elements).
        Modifiers are used as flags when a Block or Element is in a certain
        state or is different in structure or style.
      </p>
      <pre
        data-role="codeBlock"
        data-info="{.sourceCode .css}"
        class="language- sourceCode css"
      ><code>/* block component */
.block {
}
/* element */
.block__element {
}
/* modifier */
.block__element--modifier {
}

</code></pre>
      <p>Here is an example with the class names on markup:</p>
      <pre
        data-role="codeBlock"
        data-info="{.sourceCode .html}"
        class="language- sourceCode html"
      ><code>&lt;nav class="navbar"&gt;
  &lt;a href="/" class="navbar__link navbar__link--active"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/" class="navbar__link"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/" class="navbar__link"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>
        In this case, <code>navbar</code> is the Block,
        <code>navbar__link</code> is an Element that makes no sense outside of
        the <code>navbar</code> component, and
        <code>navbar__link--active</code> is a Modifier that indicates a
        different state for the <code>navbar__link</code> Element.<br />
        Since Modifiers are verbose, many opt to use <code>is-*</code> flags
        instead as modifiers.
      </p>
      <pre
        data-role="codeBlock"
        data-info="{.sourceCode .html}"
        class="language- sourceCode html"
      ><code>&lt;a href="/" class="navbar__link is-active"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

</code></pre>
      <p>
        These must be chained to the Element and never alone however, or there
        will be scope issues.
      </p>

        data-role="codeBlock"

      <p>
        Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the time
        complexity of an algorithm. The best algorithms will execute the fastest
        and have the simplest complexity.<br />
        Algorithms don't always perform the same and may vary based on the data
        they are supplied. While in some cases they will execute quickly, in
        other cases they will execute slowly, even with the same number of
        elements to deal with.<br />
        In these examples, the base time is 1 element = <code>1ms</code> .

        Linear time complexity. The execution time will increase linearly with
        the number of elements the array has. If the array has 1000 elements and
        the function takes 1ms to execute, 7000 elements will take 7ms to
        execute. This is because the function must iterate through all elements
        of the array before returning a result.

      </h3>

      <p>
        Browsers have a cache to temporarily store files on websites so they
        don't need to be re-downloaded again when switching between pages or
        reloading the same page. The server is set up to send headers that tell
        the browser to store the file for a given amount of time. This greatly
        increases website speed and preserves bandwidth.<br />
        However, it can cause problems when the website has been changed by
        developers because the user's cache still references old files. This can
        either leave them with old functionality or break a website if the
        cached CSS and JavaScript files are referencing elements that no longer
        exist, have moved or have been renamed.<br />
        Cache busting is the process of forcing the browser to download the new
        files. This is done by naming the file something different to the old
        file.<br />
        A common technique to force the browser to re-download the file is to
        append a query string to the end of the file.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>src="js/script.js"</code> =&gt;
          <code>src="js/script.js?v=2"</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The browser considers it a different file but prevents the need to
        change the file name.

      <p>
        Refactoring the functions to return promises and using
        <code>async/await</code> is usually the best option. Instead of
        supplying the functions with callbacks that cause deep nesting, they
        return a promise that can be <code>await</code> ed and will be resolved
        once the data has arrived, allowing the next line of code to be
        evaluated in a sync-like fashion.<br />
        The above code can be restructured like so:

      <p>There are lots of ways to solve the issue of callback hells:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Modularization: break callbacks into independent functions</li>
        <li>Use a control flow library, like async</li>
        <li>Use generators with Promises</li>
        <li>Use async/await (from v7 on)</li>

      <p>
        The callback function is invoked when <code>setState</code> has finished
        and the component gets rendered. Since <code>setState</code> is
        asynchronous, the callback function is used for any post action.

        Callback refs are preferred over the <code>findDOMNode()</code> API, due
        to the fact that <code>findDOMNode()</code> prevents certain
        improvements in React in the future.

      <p>
        Callbacks are functions passed as an argument to another function to be
        executed once an event has occurred or a certain task is complete, often
        used in asynchronous code. Callback functions are invoked later by a
        piece of code but can be declared on initialization without being
        invoked.<br />
        As an example, event listeners are asynchronous callbacks that are only
        executed when a specific event occurs.

        However, callbacks can also be synchronous. The following
        <code>map</code> function takes a callback function that is invoked
        synchronously for each iteration of the loop (array element).

        <code>children</code> is part of the props object passed to components
        that allows components to be passed as data to other components,
        providing the ability to compose components cleanly. There are a number
        of methods available in the React API to work with this prop, such as
        <code>React. Children.map</code> ,
        <code>React. Children.forEach</code> ,
        <code>React. Children.count</code> ,
        <code>React.Children.only</code> and
        <code>React. Children.toArray</code> . A simple usage example of the
        children prop is as follows:

      <p>
        React's philosophy in the beginning was to align with the browser DOM
        API rather than HTML, since that more closely represents how elements
        are created. Setting a <code>class</code> on an element meant using the
        <code>className</code> API:
      </p>
      <pre
        data-role="codeBlock"
        data-info="js"
        class="language-javascript"
      ><span class="token keyword">const</span> element <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token dom variable">document</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">createElement</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"div"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
element<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">className</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"hello"</span>
</pre>
      <p>
        Additionally, before ES5, reserved words could not be used in objects:
      </p>
      <pre
        data-role="codeBlock"
        data-info="js"
        class="language-javascript"
      ><span class="token keyword">const</span> element <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    attributes<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        <span class="token keyword">class</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"hello"</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</pre>
      <p>
        In IE8, this will throw an error.<br />
        In modern environments, destructuring will throw an error if trying to
        assign to a variable:

      <p>
        However, <code>class</code> <em>can</em> be used as a prop without
        problems, as seen in other libraries like Preact. React currently allows
        you to use <code>class</code> , but will throw a warning and convert it
        to <code>className</code> under the hood. There is currently an open
        thread (as of January 2019) discussing changing
        <code>className</code> to <code>class</code> to reduce confusion.

      <p>
        Using the object spread operator <code>...</code> , the object's own
        enumerable properties can be copied into the new object. This creates a
        shallow clone of the object.
      </p>

      <p>
        With this technique, prototypes are ignored. In addition, nested objects
        are not cloned, but rather their references get copied, so nested
        objects still refer to the same objects as the original. Deep-cloning is
        much more complex in order to effectively clone any type of object
        (Date, RegExp, Function, Set, etc) that may be nested within the
        object.<br />
        Other alternatives include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))</code> can be used to deep-clone
          a simple object, but it is CPU-intensive and only accepts valid JSON
          (therefore it strips functions and does not allow circular
          references).
        </li>
        <li><code>Object.assign({}, obj)</code> is another alternative.</li>
        <li>
          <code
            >Object.keys(obj).reduce((acc, key) =&gt; (acc[key] = obj[key],
            acc), {})</code
          >
          is another more verbose alternative that shows the concept in greater
          depth.
        </li>

        A closure is a function defined inside another function and has access
        to its lexical scope even when it is executing outside its lexical
        scope. The closure has access to variables in three scopes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Variables declared in its own scope</li>
        <li>Variables declared in the scope of the parent function</li>
        <li>Variables declared in the global scope</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, all functions are closures because they have access to
        the outer scope, but most functions don't utilise the usefulness of
        closures: the persistence of state. Closures are also sometimes called
        stateful functions because of this.<br />
        In addition, closures are the only way to store private data that can't
        be accessed from the outside in JavaScript. They are the key to the UMD
        (Universal Module Definition) pattern, which is frequently used in
        libraries that only expose a public API but keep the implementation
        details private, preventing name collisions with other libraries or the
        user's own code.

          Closures are useful because they let you associate data with a

      </h3>

      <p>
        Even though two different objects can have the same properties with
        equal values, they are not considered equal when compared using
        <code>==</code> or <code>===</code> . This is because they are being
        compared by their reference (location in memory), unlike primitive
        values which are compared by value.<br />
        In order to test if two objects are equal in structure, a helper
        function is required. It will iterate through the own properties of each
        object to test if they have the same values, including nested objects.
        Optionally, the prototypes of the objects may also be tested for
        equivalence by passing
        <code>true</code> as the 3rd argument.<br />
        Note: this technique does not attempt to test equivalence of data
        structures other than plain objects, arrays, functions, dates and
        primitive values.

        Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without
        having to pass props down manually at every level. For example,
        authenticated user, locale preference, UI theme need to be accessed in
        the application by many components.

      <p>
        Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or CORS is a mechanism that uses
        additional HTTP headers to grant a browser permission to access
        resources from a server at an origin different from the website
        origin.<br />
        An example of a cross-origin request is a web application served from
        <code>http://mydomain.com</code> that uses AJAX to make a request for
        <code>http://yourdomain.com</code> .<br />
        For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests
        initiated by JavaScript.
        <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> and <code>fetch</code> follow the
        same-origin policy, meaning a web application using those APIs can only
        request HTTP resources from the same origin the application was
        accessed, unless the response from the other origin includes the correct
        CORS headers.

        CSS preprocessors add useful functionality that native CSS does not
        have, and generally make CSS neater and more maintainable by enabling
        DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles. Their terse syntax for nested
        selectors cuts down on repeated code. They provide variables for
        consistent theming (however, CSS variables have largely replaced this
        functionality) and additional tools like color functions (
        <code>lighten</code> , <code>darken</code> ,
        <code>transparentize</code> , etc), mixins, and loops that make CSS more
        like a real programming language and gives the developer more power to
        generate complex CSS.

      <p>
        The Adjacent Sibling Selector <code>+</code> selects all elements that

      <p>
        Assuming the browser has already determined the set of rules for an
        element, each rule is assigned a matrix of values, which correspond to
        the following from highest to lowest specificity:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inline rules (binary - 1 or 0)</li>
        <li>Number of id selectors</li>
        <li>Number of class, pseudo-class and attribute selectors</li>
        <li>Number of tags and pseudo-element selectors</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When two selectors are compared, the comparison is made on a per-column
        basis (e.g.&nbsp;an id selector will always be higher than any amount of
        class selectors, as ids have higher specificity than classes). In cases
        of equal specificity between multiple rules, the rules that comes last
        in the page's style sheet is deemed more specific and therefore applied
        to the element.

      <p>
        Debouncing is a process to add some delay before executing a function.
        It is commonly used with DOM event listeners to improve the performance
        of page. It is a technique which allow us to "group" multiple sequential
        calls in a single one. A raw DOM event listeners can easily trigger 20+
        events per second. A debounced function will only be called once the
        delay has passed.

      </h3>

      <p>
        The DOM (Document Object Model) is a cross-platform API that treats HTML
        and XML documents as a tree structure consisting of nodes. These nodes
        (such as elements and text nodes) are objects that can be
        programmatically manipulated and any visible changes made to them are
        reflected live in the document. In a browser, this API is available to
        JavaScript where DOM nodes can be manipulated to change their styles,
        contents, placement in the document, or interacted with through event
        listeners.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mume-header" id="span-stylecolorred-dont-forget-28">

      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming
          language, making the structural representation of the document
          available from a single, consistent API.
        </li>
        <li>
          The DOM is constructed progressively in the browser as a page loads,
          which is why scripts are often placed at the bottom of a page, in the
          <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> with a <code>defer</code> attribute, or
          inside a <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event listener. Scripts that
          manipulate DOM nodes should be run after the DOM has been constructed
          to avoid errors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>document.getElementById()</code> and
          <code>document.querySelector()</code> are common functions for
          selecting DOM nodes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Setting the <code>innerHTML</code> property to a new value runs the
          string through the HTML parser, offering an easy way to append dynamic
          HTML content to a node.

      <p>
        Triple equals ( <code>===</code> ) checks for strict equality, which
        means both the type and value must be the same. Double equals (
        <code>==</code> ) on the other hand first performs type coercion so that
        both operands are of the same type and then applies strict comparison.

          Whenever possible, use triple equals to test equality because loose

      <p>
        An element is a plain JavaScript object that represents a DOM node or
        component. Elements are pure and never mutated, and are cheap to
        create.<br />
        A component is a function or class. Components can have state and take
        props as input and return an element tree as output (although they can
        represent generic containers or wrappers and don't necessarily have to
        emit DOM). Components can initiate side effects in lifecycle methods
        (e.g.&nbsp;AJAX requests, DOM mutations, interfacing with 3rd party
        libraries) and may be expensive to create.

      <p>
        Both <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> units are based on the
        <code>font-size</code> CSS property. The only difference is where they
        inherit their values from.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>em</code> units inherit their value from the
          <code>font-size</code> of the parent element
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>rem</code> units inherit their value from the
          <code>font-size</code> of the root element (<code>html</code>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In most browsers, the <code>font-size</code> of the root element is set
        to <code>16px</code> by default.

      <p>
        Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors
        anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a
        fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.<br />
        Class components become error boundaries if they define either (or both)
        of the lifecycle methods
        <code>static getDerivedStateFromError()</code> or
        <code>componentDidCatch().</code>

      <p>
        Event delegation is a technique of delegating events to a single common
        ancestor. Due to event bubbling, events "bubble" up the DOM tree by
        executing any handlers progressively on each ancestor element up to the
        root that may be listening to it.<br />
        DOM events provide useful information about the element that initiated
        the event via
        <code>Event.target</code> . This allows the parent element to handle
        behavior as though the target element was listening to the event, rather
        than all children of the parent or the parent itself.<br />
        This provides two main benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It increases performance and reduces memory consumption by only
          needing to register a single event listener to handle potentially
          thousands of elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          If elements are dynamically added to the parent, there is no need to
          register new event listeners for them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Instead of:</p>

      </h3>

      <p>
        Event-driven programming is a paradigm that involves building
        applications that send and receive events. When the program emits
        events, the program responds by running any callback functions that are
        registered to that event and context, passing in associated data to the
        function. With this pattern, events can be emitted into the wild without
        throwing errors even if no functions are subscribed to it.<br />
        A common example of this is the pattern of elements listening to DOM
        events such as <code>click</code> and <code>mouseenter</code> , where a
        callback function is run when the event occurs.
      </p>
      <pre

</pre>
      <p>Without the context of the DOM, the pattern may look like this:</p>

      <p>
        There are two main syntactic categories in JavaScript: expressions and
        statements. A third one is both together, referred to as an expression
        statement. They are roughly summarized as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Expression</strong>: produces a value</li>
        <li><strong>Statement</strong>: performs an action</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Expression statement</strong>: produces a value and performs
          an action
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A general rule of thumb:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          If you can print it or assign it to a variable, it's an expression. If
          you can't, it's a statement.
        </p>

        The only expression in the above code is <code>y &gt;= 0</code> which
        produces a value, either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> . A
        value is not produced by other parts of the code.

        There is an equivalent version of the set of statements used before as

        <span style="color: red"> Answer</span>
      </h3>

      <p>
        A value is either truthy or falsy depending on how it is evaluated in a
        Boolean context. Falsy means false-like and truthy means true-like.
        Essentially, they are values that are coerced to <code>true</code> or
        <code>false</code> when performing certain operations.<br />
        There are 6 falsy values in JavaScript. They are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>false</code></li>
        <li><code>undefined</code></li>
        <li><code>null</code></li>
        <li><code>""</code> (empty string)</li>
        <li><code>NaN</code></li>
        <li><code>0</code> (both <code>+0</code> and <code>-0</code>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Every other value is considered truthy.<br />
        A value's truthiness can be examined by passing it into the
        <code>Boolean</code> function.
      </p>

</pre>
      <p>
        There is a shortcut for this using the logical NOT
        <code>!</code> operator. Using <code>!</code> once will convert a value
        to its inverse boolean equivalent (i.e.&nbsp;not false is true), and
        <code>!</code> once more will convert back, thus effectively converting
        the value to a boolean.

      <p>
        Because of JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion (ASI), the
        compiler places a semicolon after <code>return</code> keyword and
        therefore it returns <code>undefined</code> without an error being
        thrown.

              Vim is one of the most popular text editors among advanced
              programmers. It allows text-editing to be done very efficiently

              extensible and integrates with shells (command lines) really well.
              The only setback about Vim is that it has a high learning curve
              for beginners.

              Emacs is another popular text editor (or development environment
              to be more precise). The debate on "Vim vs. Emacs" is constantly
              brought up due to their popularity. Basically Emacs is more than
              just a text editor. It has plugins like file managers, web
              browsers, mail clients and news clients that allows users to
              performs these tasks directly inside Emacs. Emacs is "heavier"
              because of this, but it arguably has a relatively easier learning
              curve for beginners.

              Spring is a framework for dependency injection: a design pattern

              injecting dependencies into classes.

            <em>Data race</em>. When an evaluation of an expression writes to a
            memory location and another evaluation reads or modifies the same
            memory location, the expressions are said to conflict. A program
            that has two conflicting evaluations has a data race unless
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              both evaluations execute on the same thread or in the same signal

            </li>
            <li>
              both conflicting evaluations are atomic operations (see
