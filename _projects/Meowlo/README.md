# Meowlo

This is a small project to practice Node.js. Using request, hbs, express.js, Dark Sky api and Mapbox api. I also combined my previous two small projects: the Hangman game and To-do list into this one. At the same time, I want to practice my UI, UX, story-telling marketing skills. It was a lot of fun doing this project.
The app can be tested at:
